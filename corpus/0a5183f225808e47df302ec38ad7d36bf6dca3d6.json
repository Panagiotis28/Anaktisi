This study was a retrospective observational cohort study based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19-tested cases and history of medical service use for the past 3 years in these patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was need for ventilator care. Among 7590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on NSAID or acetaminophen prescription within 2 weeks before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 398 patients was prescribed NSAIDs, and 2365 patients were prescribed acetaminophen. After propensity score matching, 397 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the NSAIDs group showed no significant difference compared with the acetaminophen group (4.0% vs. 3.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-2.88; P = 0.46). The rate of ventilator care also did not show significantly different results between the two groups (2.0% vs. 1.3%; HR, 1.60; 95% CI 0.53-5.30; P = 0.42). Use of NSAIDs was not associated with mortality or ventilator care in Covid-19 patients. NSAIDs may be safely used to relieve symptoms in patients with suspicion of Covid-19.",

However, there are limited data on the safety of NSAID treatment in Covid-19. A recent meta-analysis revealed only indirect evidence, and there is no direct evidence on severe adverse events, acute health care utilization, long-term survival, or quality of life as a result of use of NSAIDs in patients with Covid-19 7 . A small, single-center study reported that use of ibuprofen in Covid-19 patients led to no higher mortality or need for respiratory support compared with acetaminophen or no antipyretic agent 10 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In the present study, we compared NSAID with acetaminophen use within 2 weeks before Covid-19 diagnosis and showed no significant difference in mortality or need for ventilator support.

NSAID types was entered into the OHDSI repository (http://atlas -covid 19.ohdsi .org/#/conce ptset /454/conce ptset -expre ssion ). For the comparator cohort, we selected patients with acetaminophen prescription within 2 weeks before Covid-19 diagnosis.

The analysis was conducted under requests of investigators at https ://hira-covid 19.net. OHDSI analysis tools were built into the ATLAS interactive analysis platform and the OHDSI Methods Library R packages. ATLAS ver. 2.7.2 was used herein. As OHDSI CDM does not reveal exact numbers of patients for each covariate, we presented only incidences of baseline characteristics and used Cox regression analysis to compare outcomes. To minimize the effects of potential confounding factors and selection bias, we used large-scale propensity score matching with caliper 0.2 and generated a matched population to the cohorts without sample replacement. For the propensity score matching, we used Cyclops package in R programming to fit a large-scale regularized logistic regression 18 , and variables retained in the matching included age, female sex, and diagnosis codes with non-zero coefficients during 1 year prior to the diagnosis of Covid-19. The propensity score was stratified into 5 strata, and the Cox regression analysis retained strata. For sensitivity analysis, we conducted the same analysis for 30-day follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to construct survival curves and compared using the log-rank test. All tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
