Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were assigned to recovery group if they made a full recovery and to death group if they died within 2 months of hospitalization. Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazypaving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range; 0, none; 25, maximum). 40 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and six patients who died were enrolled. The initial chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from COVID-19. Most patients had subpleural lesions (89.0%) as well as bilateral (87.0%) and lower (93.0%) lung lobe involvement. Diffuse lesions were present in four (67%) patients who succumbed to coronavirus but only one (2.5%) patient who recovered (p < 0.001). In the death group of patients, the total CT score was higher than that of the recovery group (p = 0.005). Patients in the death group had lower lymphocyte count and higher C-reactive protein than those in the recovery group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.041, respectively). A high CT score and diffuse distribution of lung lesions in COVID-19 are indicative of disease severity and shortterm mortality.",

Our study highlights the clinical implication of initial CT findings as a prognostic indicator in patients with COVID-19. Upon comparing those who recovered with those who did not, neither ground-glass opacity, consolidation, nor crazy-paving pattern were associated with final outcomes. However, fibrosis was observed in six who recovered and none who died. We speculate that fibrotic changes may have resulted from organizing pneumonia patterns of lung injury with COVID-19. Jae et al. 16 found the remaining opacity of MERS in the intubation group and that fibrosis was a sequela on follow-up chest radiographies. Similar to other acute lung injuries, fibrosis is thought to be the result of resolution 13, 17 . Fibrosis was in the early stages, assuming all of the patients were in an early stage of infection and underwent initial CT scans from symptom onset with a mean interval of 5 \u00b1 3 days. This may be associated with good prognosis in early chest CT examinations. In our patients, pleural effusion was not present in those with COVID-19. Karuna et al. 18 reported that the early appearance of pleural effusion was a predictor of short-term mortality in patients with MERS; however, this relationship was not demonstrated in our patients with COVID-19.",

Patients who died had higher CT lung scores versus those who recovered in our study, indicating the rapid development of the disease process. The largest area of the lung was occupied by pneumonia. Similar to our study, Zhao et al. 19 reported that the CT involvement score can help evaluate the severity and extent of COVID-19. The area of the affected lung lobes in expired patients was greater than those who recovered. The predominant peripheral distribution of abnormalities was observed in our study; however, four patients who died and one who recovered showed diffuse distribution of lung lesions. Patients with diffuse lung lesions were more likely to die than those with subpleural lesions. These factors are consistent with diffuse alveolar damage patterns that may cause worse Figure 2 . A 57-year-old man with a history of recent travel to Wuhan presented with fever for 10 days. (a,b) Non-contrast enhanced chest CT showed multiple peripheral patchy ground glass opacities (white arrows) and crazy-paving pattern (red arrow) in both lower lobes. CT scan also demonstrated consolidation in the left lower lobe (black arrow). CT involvement score was 11. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ outcomes for patients. Xu et al. 20 also reported a COVID-19 patient death with diffuse lung involvement on X-ray images and pathological findings of pulmonary edema and clear film formation on lung biopsy samples. These findings indicate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our results suggest that high CT scores coupled with diffuse distribution of lung lesions on admission were responsible for ensuing ARDS and a poor prognosis in most patients. Patients who died from COVID-19 had a higher C-reactive protein and lower lymphocytic count than the recovery group. Lymphocytes were reduced in the group that died, reflecting a deficiency of adaptive immune response. Lymphopenia and high plasma levels of C-reactive protein may be related to cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 as postulated by a previous report 1 . In our study, older subjects, and those with hypertension were statistically associated with mortality; however, we did not see a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of sex and diabetics. These factors were congruent with the MuLBSTA score 21 for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia and may have played a role in the death of patients with COVID-19.",
