            "text": "Niclosamide (NIC) has demonstrated promising in vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though NIC is already FDAapproved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 [1] . A rapid and continuing rise in cases worldwide followed this declaration which has overwhelmed healthcare systems [2, 3] . At present, there are limited treatment and vaccination options for coronaviruses, and outbreaks are expected to continue potentially into 2025 [4] . To address the ongoing pandemic, it is necessary that treatments are made rapidly available and at low-cost to patients and clinicians worldwide. One mechanism for achieving this has been to assess existing drugs for their utility against SARS--CoV-2. Recently, a screening of 48 FDA-approved drugs revealed that a compound called niclosamide (NIC), which has been historically utilized to treat intestinal tapeworms, also exhibits highly potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a Vero cell infection model [5] . NIC has been previously demonstrated to enhance host cell autophagy in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections through inhibition of SKP2 [6] , and it is hypothesized that a similar mechanism of action may enable its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity [5] . The broad-spectrum pharmaceutical utility of NIC appears to be related to its protonophoric activity, which results in disruptions of membrane pH gradients that may cause alterations in several signaling pathways [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The drug's non-specific mechanism of action is illustrated by its efficacy against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus [17] [18] [19] , Pseudomonas aeruginosa [20] [21] [22] , Acinetobacter baumannii [20, 23] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24, 25] , and various bacterial biofilms [18, 19, 26] , which may enable protection against secondary bacterial pneumonias associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, NIC has been noted to inhibit inflammatory cytokine release in lung tissues in vivo [27] , which may provide an important protective effect against cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most feared sequela of COVID-19.",

            "text": "In terms of pharmaceutical development, a major limitation of NIC as an effective antiviral therapy stems from its poor solubility in water, which is reported at 1.6 mg/L [28] . This makes systemic absorption of therapeutically relevant concentrations of the drug difficult by the oral route. For example, administration of the existing FDA-approved chewable tablet formulation was found to produce inadequate systemic concentrations for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication [29, 30] . As an alternative, direct delivery of NIC to the lung could overcome the limitations of the oral NIC formulation by generating high drug concentrations at the site of infection. For use against P. aeruginosa, Costabile et al previously developed an inhalable dry powder consisting of NIC nanocrystals embedded in mannitol particles [31] . However, these particles required a high amount of polysorbate 80 to ensure production of a stable suspension (10% w/w to NIC) which is beyond what is in currently FDA approved inhaled products [32] . Furthermore, the utilization of mannitol as the carrier system may induce bronchospasm and cough [33] [34] [35] which may contribute to increased risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through generation of aerosolized respiratory droplets from infected individuals.",

Patients may act as asymptomatic carriers of the virus or develop severe pneumonias and acute respiratory disease [36] , which can result in the requirement for mechanical ventilation. In the case of ventilated patients, a nebulizer is often used to delivery aerosolized drug to the lungs. However, for treatment of asymptomatic carriers or in regions of developing economies with reduced access to clean water sources, nebulizer-based aqueous products may present an undue burden and reduce therapy compliance. For these populations, dry powder inhaler (DPI) or nasal spray systems, or a combination of both, would be the preferred option based upon the rapid administration time and ease of use and could also potentially be utilized as a prophylactic therapy in high-risk populations such as healthcare workers and first responders.",

To achieve these aims, we utilized human lysozyme (hLYS), an endogenous protein in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, as a carrier system for the delivery of NIC to the airways. Utilization of hLYS for delivery provides an endogenous alternative to traditional large particle carrier systems based upon lactose. Lysozyme has known anti-inflammatory [37] , antiviral [38] [39] [40] [41] , and anti-bacterial activity [42] [43] [44] , and its inclusion in the formulation was hypothesized to enable reconstitution of the powder into a NIC suspension at the time of administration, based upon the surface active nature of the protein. The composition of the NIC-hLYS formulation was optimized using a constrained mixtures Design of Experiments (DoE) to achieve particles with a size appropriate for inhalation both in the dry powder state and when reconstituted in aqueous media. Physicochemical characterization of the optimized powder was performed, and nasal, DPI, and nebulizer systems were developed and tested. The optimized NIC-hLYS powder was then evaluated in vitro and in vivo for efficacy against two different coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to confirm the broad-spectrum activity of NIC and utility in managing current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activity and efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were assessed in vitro to evaluate the utility of NIC-hLYS in preventing two important COVID-19 sequalae: ARDS and secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

Performance was assessed at both a 4kPa and 2kPa pressure drop through the device to determine the effects of inspiratory flow rate on emitted and fine particle dose. The aerosol performance of a traditional lactose carrier-based dry powder, NIC-Lac, was also assessed in order to determine the impact of substituting the novel hLYS-based carrier matrix into the formulation. A 4 kPa pressure drop was generated through the TwinCaps DPI using an inspiratory flow rate of 40 L/min. A 6.5 second actuation time was used to pull 4 L of air through the NGI. A 2 kPa pressure drop was generated using an inspiratory flow rate of 28.3 L/min, and an 8 second actuation time was used. For all experiments, 60 mg of powder was loaded into the device (30 mg per chamber, each chamber actuated separately) to ensure sufficient deposition of NIC on the NGI stages for quantification. After actuation of the NIC-hLYS powder from both device chambers, NIC was collected by dissolving the deposited powder using a 50-50 water:acetonitrile mix. An aliquot was taken, and an additional volume of acetonitrile was added to bring the final ratio to 20:80 water:acetonitrile. To induce phase separation, A 2M solution of ammonium acetate was added to this mixture at a volume that was 20% of the water:acetonitrile mix. NIC was assayed from the upper organic layer by measuring absorbance at 331nm using a plate reader. For the niclosamide-lactose blend, the deposited powder was collected by dissolving it in 20:80 water:acetonitrile, centrifuging, and then measuring absorbance at 331nm. For all experiments, the suitability of the analytical method was confirmed by calculating the mass balance of recovered versus loaded NIC, with a target of 90-110% recovery of the loaded NIC dose.",

            "text": "To determine the utility of hLYS as a carrier molecule for the nasal and pulmonary delivery of NIC, we assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of our novel formulation against a lysozyme-free NIC suspension (NIC-M). NIC-hLYS particles (0.7% w/w NIC) were administered at varying doses (based upon NIC content) to Vero E6 cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, and the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) was calculated based upon observed cytopathic effect (CPE). The addition of hLYS to the NIC formulation resulted in improved antiviral activity based upon reductions in the EC 50 dose for MERS-CoV (0.016 \u03bcg/mL NIC to 0.0625 \u03bcg/mL NIC) and SARS-CoV-2 (0.030 \u03bcg/mL NIC to 0.008 \u03bcg/mL NIC) (Fig 1A and  1B) . We assessed the antiviral dose-response of NIC-hLYS particles in a separate assay utilizing qPCR quantification of viral RNA collected from infected cells. At the highest dose tested (0.125 \u03bcg/mL NIC), Vero cells with an established MERS-CoV infection exhibited an 82.2% \u00b1 0.4% decrease in viral load compared to untreated controls after 24-hours of exposure to NIC-hLYS particles (Fig 1D) . This effect was sustained at 48 hours post-drug exposure (92.7% \u00b1 1.2%). A similar dose-response profile was achieved in Vero cells with an established SARS--CoV-2 infection (Fig 1E) . A dose 0.125 \u03bcg/mL NIC resulted in a 24-hour inhibition of 92.7% \u00b1 0.3% relative to untreated controls. However, in contrast to the MERS-CoV response, inhibition dropped to 67.5% \u00b1 1.3% at 48 hours post-exposure in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. A separately conducted trypan blue viability assay in uninfected Vero E6 cells determined that the highest dose of NIC-hLYS utilized (0.125 \u03bcg/mL) had no effect on cell viability versus untreated controls (98.3% viability in treated cells). , which indicates that improvements in solubility alone may not be sufficient to achieve maximal antiviral efficacy (C). Similar dose response profiles were noted for NIC-hLYS in both MERS-CoV (D) and SARS-CoV-2 (E), where an initial decrease in the activity is preceded by a sharp rise in activity. This profile was also noted in inhibitory assays for S. aureus. hLYS alone exhibits some antiviral activity which was more pronounced at 48 hours post dosing than 24 hours (F).

Interestingly, hLYS alone appeared to exhibit activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1F) , which has not been previously reported. Though the inhibitory activity was not as potent as that of NIC, it may contribute to observed increase in potency of NIC-hLYS in the CPE-based EC50 assay. NIC-hLYS, NIC-M and NIC dissolved in DMSO (NIC-DMSO) were compared for their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at a NIC dose of 0.125 \u03bcg/mL. A two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test revealed a statistically significant increase in viral inhibition in cells dosed with NIC-hLYS particles versus NIC-DMSO at 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and 48 hours (p = 0.0001), though no significant differences were noted in the viral inhibition of NIC-hLYS and NIC-M formulations at the tested dose (Fig 1C) , Thus, an improvement in solubility does not appear to be the mechanism for the increased activity of NIC-hLYS.",

Both NIC and hLYS are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of two NIC formulations, NIC-BSA and NIC-hLYS, was assessed using an acute macrophage inflammation model. NIC-hLYS and NIC-BSA exhibited similar suppression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 4D and 4E) .

However, the wide range of symptoms and disease severity associated with COVID-19 makes development of a broadly applicable therapy difficult. The clinical applicability of our novel NIC-hLYS formulation was assessed by determining the delivery efficiency of the drug using three commercially available respiratory drug delivery platforms: a disposable DPI (Twin-Caps1), a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo1) and a nasal spray (VP7 Aptar1). The composition of spray dried NIC-hLYS particles was optimized using a constrained-mixtures DoE to achieve respirable dry particles (geometric median diameter \ufffd 5 \u03bcm) that could be easily reconstituted as suspension suitable for nasal spray or nebulizer-based administration. The DoE generated several promising powder formulations (Table 2) , of which formulation 8 (F8) was selected for further characterization based upon its suitable dry and reconstituted particle size distribution, as well the increased level of polysorbate 80, which was anticipated to reduce particle settling in the reconstituted suspension and improve particle dissolution upon deposition.",

The rapid administration time for the device as well as the compact size improves patient acceptability and compliance. A disposable DPI is likely to be preferred in the treatment of COVID-19, given the currently unknown risks regarding re-infectability. A commercially available disposable DPI, the TwinCaps1 (Hovione) was therefore selected as an exemplary delivery platform. NIC-hLYS powder inhalation was successfully delivered using the TwinCaps DPI, with a 136.0 \u00b1 4.3 \u03bcg NIC fine particle dose (i.e., recovered drug mass with less than 5 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter) achieved per 60 mg total powder actuation (0.7% NIC content) when using inhalation flow rate conditions reflective of a healthy patient (Fig 5H) . Given the potential for shortness of breath and reduced inspiratory abilities that may occur in COVID-19, the delivery efficiency was also examined using inhalation flow-rate conditions reflective of a patient with reduced lung capacity due to illness or age. Similar fine particle doses (121.1 \u00b1 4.4 \u03bcg) were achieved in these reduced inhalation flow rate conditions, which indicates a minimal dependence on inspiratory flow rate to achieve successful delivery of the drug to the peripheral lung regions. Micronized niclosamide (A) was embedded in a matrix of human lysozyme and stabilizers using spray drying (B). This novel system was developed as an alternative to traditional lactose-based carrier systems (C) and enabled the targeted respiratory delivery of NIC as a powder via DPI or a reconstituted suspension via nebulizer or nasal spray. The optimized formulation exhibited a size distribution that was appropriate for inhalation (i.e., geometric median diameter < 5 \u03bcm) in both the dry powder state as well as when reconstituted using water or 0.45% sodium chloride (D). Similar effects could not be achieved when a negatively charged protein, bovine serum albumin, was substituted in the formulation for the positively charged hLYS (E). Though hLYS is surface active, it appeared to only slightly enhance the dissolution of NIC compared to NIC particles blended with lactose (F). A respirable droplet size distribution could be achieved with multiple different reconstituted concentrations when nebulized using the Aerogen Solo1 (G). These concentrations resulted in no aggregation to the lysozyme component. Efficient aerosol delivery was achieved with both the nebulizer and disposable DPI, with~50% of the emitted dose being of an appropriate size for lung deposition. This was significantly improved compared to a traditional lactose carrier particle system (H). Reproducible plume geometry could be achieved using a variety of reconstituted concentrations when actuated using the Aptar device (I). Data is presented as mean + SEM (n = 3). \ufffd p < 0.05, using two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test (comparisons of DPIs presented only).",

As such, the feasibility of administration of the NIC-hLYS formulation using a nasal spray was assessed using spray pattern and plume geometry analysis. NIC-hLYS powders were reconstituted in 0.45% sodium chloride at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg/mL and actuated using a VP7 Aptar1 nasal spray device. Suitable plume angles and uniform spray patterns for nasal administration were achieved for all tested concentrations (Fig 5I) . An increase in plume angle was noted at increasing powder concentrations which was inversely related to changes in suspension viscosity (S3 Table) and may be reflective of the decreased surface tension resulting from the presence of hLYS and other surface-active stabilizers. The utilization of a slightly hypotonic reconstitution medium (S4 Table) was selected and used in the in vivo studies to improve absorption and potentially assist nose-to-brain penetration of NIC-hLYS. The decreases in brain and kidney viral titers noted in vivo when NIC-hLYS was administered intranasally may reflect an achievement of therapeutic drug concentrations outside the respiratory passageways, though this will be evaluated further in a future pharmacokinetic study.",

Direct delivery to the airways represents a promising alternative to oral delivery, as it would enable achievement of high levels of drug at the site of disease. However, limited solubility and delayed dissolution of niclosamide particles in the upper respiratory tract could result in rapid clearance of the particles by the mucocilliary escalator or through alveolar macrophage uptake. hLYS exhibits surface active properties which could enhance the dissolution rate of poorly water soluble NIC particles. To test this hypothesis, the dissolution rate of NIC-hLYS particles exhibiting an aerodynamic diameter of~2 \u03bcm was compared against hLYS-free NIC particles in simulated lung fluid medium. Though the deposited particles exhibited equivalent sizes and surface areas, the inclusion of hLYS as a formulation component resulted in a slightly faster rate of dissolution, with 82.1% the deposited dose of NIC dissolved by 6 hours (Fig 5F) .",

We have previously demonstrated that hen egg white lysozyme is robust to processinduced aggregation using typical particle engineering techniques [45] , which provided part of the rationale for its selection as a carrier for the aerosol delivery of NIC particles. Using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we investigated the formation of higher molecular weight hLYS aggregates before and after spray drying. No further increases in higher molecular weight aggregates were noted after spray drying or after nebulization at varying reconstituted concentrations (S1 Fig and Table 3 ). Interestingly, a decrease in the percentage of solubilized aggregates was noted in the spray dried hLYS formulations compared to the initial unprocessed hLYS product, which may be explained by the shift in secondary structure from towards a higher percentage of parallel \u03b2-sheet structure upon spray drying, whereas the unprocessed hLYS had a higher percentage of anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet structure ( Table 4 ). The glass transition temperature (Tg) measured for the NIC-hLYS powder was 79.4\u02daC, which makes it suitable for storage in ambient conditions without risk of further protein degradation.

Though the inclusion of hLYS did slightly increase the dissolution rate of micronized NIC particles, this alone cannot explain the increased potency, as solubilized NIC exhibited lower antiviral activity at the 0.125 \u03bcg/mL dose than both NIC-M and NIC-hLYS. HLYS plays an important role in the innate immune system, and it is found in abundance at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract as well as in the lysosomal granules of neutrophils and macrophages [65] . The antibacterial efficacy of hLYS stems from both its enzymatic activity, which results in the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds linking peptidoglycan monomers in bacterial cells walls, as well as its cationic activity, which enables insertion of the protein and formation of pores in negatively charged bacterial membranes [44] . To our knowledge, the activity of lysozyme against coronaviruses has not been previously reported. A peptide (HL9) located within the helix-loop-helix motif of hLYS has been previously demonstrated to block HIV-1 viral infection and replication, whereas mutants of HL9 did not [41] . The location of this peptide was deemed to be separate from the hydrolytic site. It is possible that this peptide sequence, or another, is responsible for the anti-coronavirus activity of hLYS. Cationic peptides have been hypothesized to exhibit antiviral activity due to a disruption of the viral particle membrane [66] . hLYS may also disrupt various signaling pathways (TGF\u03b2, p53, NF\u03baB, protein kinase C, and hedgehog signaling) which affect host cell susceptibility to viral infection [41] . An immunomodulatory response may explain the notable delay in anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at lower doses when hLYS was used alone. Additionally, a unique up-regulation in IL-1\u03b2 activity was noted for the NIC-hLYS formulation in a macrophage model of inflammatory stimulation, while expression of other inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) was decreased. IL-1 family cytokines have been previously associated with the induction of antiviral transcriptional responses in fibroblasts and epithelial cells [67] . In SARS-CoV infected African green monkeys, significantly lower levels of IL-1\u03b2 were noted in the lungs of aged monkeys compared to juvenile monkeys [68] . Similarly, elderly mice infected with influenza exhibited lower levels of 1L-1\u03b2, and administration of IL-1\u03b2 augmenting compound improved morbidity and mortality [69] . Thus, it is possible that a similar immunemediated mechanism is contributing to the increased activity of NIC-hLYS compared to other NIC formulations, though this requires further investigation. At physiological pH, hLYS exhibits a positive charge while NIC exhibits a negative charge. This attraction may contribute to the improved dispersibility of NIC suspensions when hLYS is utilized as the carrier protein, as demonstrated by the notable aggregation observed when a negatively charged protein, BSA, is used in the formulation. This charge-based interaction may have additional benefits when NIC is in the solubilized state. NIC has two substituted aromatic rings, the electronegativity of which has been deemed critical for its activity against other viruses [7] . Non-covalent interactions between aromatic compounds is a known phenomenon, which occurs as a result of the overlap of the \u03c0-orbital of the two electron clouds of the aromatic rings [70, 71] and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking of NIC is observed in the crystalline form [72] . Though not investigated in this study, it is possible that self-association of NIC molecules may disrupt the availability of the strongly electro-negative groups necessary for antiviral activity. This may explain why a decrease in antiviral activity was noted with NIC solubilized in DMSO compared to NIC particles. Interactions between NIC and hLYS in the microenvironment may serve as a mechanism to disrupt this self-association and ensure availability of the electronegative functional groups, as lysozyme has been previously demonstrated to complex with negatively charged molecules [73] and a hydrophobic drug [74] . Given the physicochemical properties of NIC, both chargedbased and hydrophobic interactions with hLYS may be important. Future studies will examine the interactions and mechanisms of complexation between NIC and hLYS to further elucidate how the molecular interactions may contribute to improved antiviral activity.",

In August 2020, the FDA approved remdesivir for the treatment of all hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19, irrespective of the severity of disease [75] . This approval is based upon a statistically significant reduction in median time to recovery for patients treated with remdesivir in a recent clinical trial [76] . However, remdesivir is currently not recommended for use in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min), which may limit its utility in severe COVID-19 infection. This contraindication stems from the incorporation of sulfobutylether\u03b2-cyclodextrin (SBECD), which is utilized as a vehicle for the poorly water soluble remdesivir in the intravenous product, and which can accumulate in cases of renal failure. Clinical trials examining inhalation-based delivery of remdesivir are currently under way [77, 78] , though details of this aerosol formulation and whether or not it contains SBECD are not provided. A study of a powder aerosol formulation of remdesivir has also been recently published [79] . These studies overall indicate the clinical interest in the development of an inhalation-based treatment for COVID-19.",

            "text": "Based upon our data, NIC may be a promising alternative or adjunct therapy to remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. A previous study examining the efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of a lethal MERS-CoV infection (5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu) followed by treatment 24 hours p.i with remdesivir resulted in~2.5-3 log reduction in viral particles in the lung tissue [80] , which is similar to the reduction noted in our study using intranasal NIC-hLYS. At the day 6 p.i. endpoint of the remdesivir MERS-CoV study, equivalent survival (50%) was noted in the treated and untreated groups. In comparison, at day 7 p.i. we noted 71.4% survival in treated animals versus 60% in untreated controls, and at day 10 p.i. 43% of treated animals had survived while 0% of untreated animals had survived. Notably, these animals continued to survive after treatment was ceased, which was reproduced in the lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection model. While it is difficult to make comparisons between the two drugs on survival improvement given differences in study length and inoculum concentration, it appears survival with NIC-hLYS treatment is comparable if not improved compared to remdesivir treatment in lethal MERS-CoV infections. Expansion of the dosing range or frequency in future studies, as well as the incorporation of prophylactic dosing may enable a significant improvement in survival to be achieved, similar to what was noted with remdesivir when used prophylactically in vivo. Furthermore, we have demonstrated in vitro efficacy of NIC-hLYS reducing complications related to COVID-19, most notably secondary bacterial pneumonia by MRSA and dampening (but not complete suppression) of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which are known markers for COVID-19 disease severity [81] . This broad-spectrum activity may provide a unique advantage for NIC-hLYS compared to other leading COVID-19 candidates as an early report on COVID-19 reported 50% of patients that died had a secondary infection [82] . Though NIC appears to be primarily renally cleared [83] , limited data is available regarding the effects that hepatic or kidney failure may have on the toxicity profile of the drug. Future studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetic distribution of NIC-hLYS delivered via the intranasal or pulmonary routes.",

            "text": "We have successfully demonstrated NIC-hLYS is effective in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of COVID-19, and importantly, scalable inhaled drug delivery systems can be developed based upon the formulation which will enable rapid availability to a global patient population. Historically, it has been observed that variations in patient inspiratory force can have profound effects on the magnitude and region of dose delivery to the airways from DPIs [84] . One of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath, reportedly occurring in 50.8% of patients [85] . Moreover, patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have shortness of breath than patients with non-severe infection [85] . NIC-hLYS powder exhibited efficient aerosol performance using a disposable DPI device even at reduce inspiratory efforts which will ensure reproducible dose delivery throughout disease progression, as well as in pediatric patients. The powder can be reconstituted at the point of care to form a stable suspension appropriate for nebulization, thus enabling treatment of both ambulatory and severely ill or mechanically ventilated patients. Based upon the observed in vitro potency of our NIC-hLYS formulation (SARS-CoV-2 EC50 of 0.03 \u03bcg/mL NIC) and an estimated lung lining fluid volume of up to 70 mL in adult humans [86] , the amount of NIC required to be deposited in the lungs for antiviral activity is quite minimal, potentially around 2 \u03bcg. Thus, despite the low NIC loading content in our powder formulation (0.7% w/w NIC), we anticipate delivery of an effective dose to be easily achieved based upon the observed fine particle dose of 136 \u03bcg NIC achieved with the TwinCaps device and a 60 mg powder load. Lastly, NIC-hLYS suspension could be reproducibly actuated using a commercially available nasal spray device and has demonstrated promising antiviral activity in vivo when administered to infected mice via the intranasal route. The utilization of a slightly hypotonic carrier may improve systemic penetration from the nasal route and promote distribution in the brain [87, 88] . SARS-CoV-2 has been found to exhibit neuroinvasive properties, and severely affected COVID-19 patients appear to be more likely to develop neurological symptoms compared to those with mild disease [89, 90] . We observed that the brain tissue of surviving, NIC-hLYS treated animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited no detectable viral particles. NIC-hLYS delivered by the intranasal route may therefore be effective in preventing viral invasion of brain tissue or reducing viral replication within brain tissue.",

In our study, we utilized a \"worst-case scenario\" of efficacy evaluation by administering lethal inoculums and initiating treatment 24 hours after the infection was established [91] . The effect of the timing of treatment initiation, i.e., prophylactic versus 24 or 48 hours p.i., was not examined. Incorporation of prophylactic dosing may result in the increased efficacy of NIC-hLYS, as the antiviral mechanism of action of NIC may be related to the prevention of viral entry into host cells [7] . Future studies will examine these variables, based upon the notable activity of the novel NIC-hLYS formulation in these initial proof-of-concept efficacy studies. Determination of range of effective doses as well as assessment of maximum tolerable doses in animal models will enable inhaled NIC-hLYS particles to move forward into clinical trials.",

In vitro, the incorporation of hLYS into the formulation was noted to improve potency against MERS-CoV and SARS--CoV-2, as well as MRSA, which is an important causative agent for secondary bacterial pneumonias associated with COVID-19. The NIC-hLYS particles exhibited suppression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which have been implicated in the development of more severe COVID-19, while elevating the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which may contribute to enhanced antiviral activity. Intranasal administration of NIC-hLYS particles improved survival and reduced viral tissue loads in vivo in two lethal coronavirus infections at a level that was comparable to the leading COVID-19 treatment candidate, remdesivir. Thus, NIC-hLYS is likely to not only have efficacy in the treatment of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but could be utilized as a treatment in future coronavirus pandemics.",
