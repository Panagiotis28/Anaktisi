Cancer patients, being immunocompromised, are historically considered highrisk for infections, although coronavirus infections are not associated with more severe disease in the immunocompromised (Gralinski and Baric, 2015; Prompetchara et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . Attenuation of immune responsiveness may, indeed, be advantageous in COVID-19. Some COVID-19 clinical studies indicate poorer outcomes for cancer patients, especially those with hematological cancers (Pinato et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020; Vijenthira et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) , but not others (Lee et al., 2020; Russell et al., 2020b) .

Basophil and plasmacytoid DC counts were likewise low but comparable to COVID-19 + non-cancer subjects (Figures 4Aiv and S4Ai ). The reduced eosinophil numbers in COVID-19 + solid cancer patients must be contextualized with atypically high eosinophil counts displayed by non-COVID-19 cancer controls (Figure 4Avi ). Consistent with the overall complexion of immune dysregulation being comparable across symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 + solid cancer patients, only reduced T cell and basophil counts correlated significantly with COVID-19 severity ( Figure 4B ), as they likewise did in COVID-19 + non-cancer patients (Laing et al., 2020) . In hematological malignancies, marked attrition of B cells was noted in COVID-19 + patients ( Figure 4Ai ).

The underlying malignancy did not offer an explanation for B cytopenia, since the hematological cancer cohorts were well balanced, with all patients in the control group diagnosed with B cell malignancies and on similar treatments to the study cohort, with a single patient in the study cohort diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) ( Table 1) . Note, this patient (64-year-old male) was a clear outlier for T cytopenia (Figure 4Aii ; brown arrow), and was the one direct COVID-19 related mortality in the hematological cancer cohort (see Figure 1B ). No other cell counts significantly segregated COVID-19 + hematological cancer patients from controls, in part because of the very high interindividual phenotypic variation of the COVID-19 cohort.",

The patient on anti-PD-1 therapy appeared as a sustained outlier with low cell counts for T cell subsets such as Th17, Th2, central and effector memory, as well as low PD-1 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells ( Figure S7B ; red circles), consistent with anti-PD-1 therapy.",

Boxplots show median, lower, and upper quartiles (box) and 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers). Each circle represents a single patient. Statistical significance highlighted in red (cell counts: t test with robust standard errors on estimated marginal means from linear regression, adjusted for age and sex, p < 0.05; cytokine concentrations: t test with robust standard errors on estimated marginal means from tobit regression, adjusted for age and sex, p < 0.05). See also Figure S4 . COVID-19 + and non-exposed cancer cohorts were well balanced for tumor type, stage, and treatment. We were able to discern immunological signatures across cancer patients that were most obviously associated with COVID-19 rather than any confounding variables. We demonstrate that the COVID-19 signature for solid cancer patients was a consensus phenotype with striking similarities to the COVID-19 signature of infected subjects without cancer. Some properties were exaggerated in COVID-19 + solid cancer patients, but the majority of patients cleared the virus, recovered from COVID-19, and reestablished immunological status quo, including several severely ill stage IV cancer patients. We provide initial evidence of sustained seroconversion in solid cancer patients, providing some measure of confidence that cancer patients are not necessarily at a higher risk of an inferior immune response to SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. Our observations, combined with the large registry studies, suggest that the principal cause of elevated mortality risk from COVID-19 in solid cancer patients is cancer progression (Kuderer et al., 2020) , which we show to correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Given recovered solid cancer patients showed no major immunological legacy, we consider that inferior COVID-19-associated cancer outcomes most likely reflect pandemic public health measures preventing optimal cancer care.",

In chronic infection, T cell exhaustion manifests as progressive and hierarchical loss of effector function with sustained upregulation and co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, including Tim3 and PD1 (Gallimore et al., 1998; McLane et al., 2019; Zajac et al., 1998) . Exhausted T cells may compromise virus clearance, consistent with the observation that >70% of COVID-19 + hematological cancer patients studied displayed prolonged viral persistence. Failure of virus elimination, and sustained levels of viral antigen may further exacerbate T cell exhaustion. Potentially compounding this, we found significantly increased CD56 bright NK cell in the ''recovered'' hematological COVID-19 + cancer patients, suggesting NK cell subsets may be skewed toward inflammation versus cytotoxicity, limiting capacity to control viral infections (Welsh and Waggoner, 2013).",

This may reflect the underlying malignancy and/or treatments such as anti-CD20 mab therapy (Cooper and Arnold, 2010) . It is reported that rituximab treatment can be associated with inadequate antibody responses depending on the viral insult (Horwitz et al., 2004; Oren et al., 2008; Villa et al., 2013) . Many patients (albeit not all) who failed to mount an antibody response with prolonged viral shedding had received anti-CD20 mab within 4 weeks prior to their first positive swab. These findings may explain conflicting clinical observations over the impact of anti-CD20 therapy on COVID-19 + patients (Gianfrancesco et al., 2020) . Our data support caution in the use of anti-CD20 mab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rossi et al., 2000) or in indolent lymphomas, especially in those situations where the risk benefit ratio is already established as only marginal. Where such treatments are essential to ensure optimal treatment, patient management should accommodate the potential for prolonged virus infection and transmission.",

Prolonged viral shedding has previously been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients (de Lima et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2020) and recent case reports of such patients with SARS-CoV-2 indicate that this can represent continued infectious virus (Avanzato et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2020) . Our results demonstrate high prevalence of prolonged positivity on rRT-PCR swab test among cancer patients in general. The implications of prolonged contagious period for public health measures in the cancer population are profound. For example, it may inform decision making on the isolation of high-risk groups, the role of widespread testing among cancer patients and (G and H) Representative flow cytometry plots and frequency analysis of (G) PD-1 + TIM3 + /CD45RA \u00c0 Th1 cell and (H) PD-1 + TIM3 + /CD45RA + CD4 \u00c0 cell.

See also Figure S6 and Article clinical decision making on which patients can safely continue or re-start anti-cancer therapies. In sum, our data provide reassurance that the immunological status of solid cancer patients does not necessarily put them at a higher risk of an inferior immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This is evidently not the case for a subset of patients with hematological malignancies. While immunological health should be only one factor in determining how to manage a cancer patient in the context of an ongoing pandemic, our findings of delayed or negligible seroconversion, prolonged shedding, and sustained immune dysregulation highlight the need for careful oversights especially of hematological cancer patients. Such issues may be particularly important when considering vaccination, boosting, and follow-up.",

It was underpowered to detect change for some groups, including the differing treatment modalities, which collectively have differing impacts on host immune compromise. Patients on chemotherapy versus targeted therapies are likely to be the most severely immunocompromised. An important question that remains unanswered is if a ''reinforced'' immune system following immunotherapy results in an under-/over-activation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Albeit anecdotally, our study cohort included only one such patient who went on to a good outcome. Another limitation is that many of the recruited COVID-19 + cancer patients required prolonged home isolation, during which time it was not feasible to capture longitudinal data through serial blood sampling. Large collaborative efforts are required to overcome the issue of small sample sizes in which regard we hope that others may adopt our readily transferrable experimental analytical SOPs, and benefit from our uploading of data to an open-access portal www. immunophenotype.org.",

            "text": "Serology Analysis by ELISA: Three SARS-CoV-2 proteins were used for serology analysis; (1) Nucleocapsid (N) protein, obtained from Leo James and Jakub Luptak at LMB, Cambridge; (2) Spike (S) protein, plasmid obtained from from Philip Brouwer, Marit van Gils and Rogier Sanders at The University of Amsterdam (Brouwer et al., 2020) ; and (3) Receptor binding domain (RBD), plasmid obtained from Florian Krammer at Mount Sinai University (Amanat et al., 2020) . The N protein is a truncated construct comprising residues 48-365 with a uncleavable hexahistidine tag N terminal. It was expressed in E. Coli using autoinducing media for 7h at 37 C and purified using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), size exclusion chromatography and heparin chromatography (Seow et al., 2020) . The S protein comprised of residues 1-1138 of the prefusion S ectodomain with a GGGG substitution at amino acids (aa) positions 682-685 in the furin cleavage site, a proline substitutions at aa 986 and 987 and a T4 trimerisation at the N terminal domain followed by a Strep-tag II. Protein expression was achieved in HEK-293F cells (Invitrogen) (1.5 million cells/mL) and transfected with 325 mg of DNA at a 1:3 ratio using PEI-Max (1 mg/mL, Polysciences). Supernatant was purified using StrepTactinXT Superflow high capacity 50% suspension according to the manufacturer's protocol by gravity flow (IBA Life Sciences) after 7 days of harvesting. The RBD proteins consists of residues 319-541 with a fusion at the start of the sequence of the S protein natural N-terminal signal peptide and joined to C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Protein expression again was achieved in HEK-293F cells at a density of 1.5 million cells/mL transfected with 1000 mg of DNA using PEI-Max at a ratio of 1:3 with supernatant purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads after 7 days of harvesting. An in-house ELISA was used to detect antibodies in heat-inactivated plasma samples (56 C for 30 mins). High-binding ELISA plates (Corning, 3690) were coated with 3 mg/mL of antigens (N, S or RBD) in PBS (overnight at 4 C or 2 hr at 37 C), then washed with PBS-T and blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T (RT, 60 min). Plasma was diluted in milk at 1:25 respectively then added onto the plate and incubated at RT for 2h, followed by a wash, next adding the secondary antibody at 1:1000 (RT, 60 min), then a final wash before adding the substrate. Substrates used were either AP substrate (Sigma) read at 405 nm (AP), or 1-step TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific) read at 450 nm (HRP). IgG was detected using Goat-anti-human-Fc-AP (Jackson: 109-055-098 -JIR) and IgM was detected using Goat-anti-human-IgM-HRP (Sigma: A6907). Control reagents were CR3009 (2 mg/mL), CR3022 (0.2 mg/mL), negative control plasma (1:25), positive control plasma (1:50) and blank wells. Data were normalized using a min/max normalization to compare samples across batches. Values >0.15 were considered positive, which is 4 fold of background based on results from 300 patient samples pre-COVID-19 (Pickering et al., 2020) (Table S4) .",
