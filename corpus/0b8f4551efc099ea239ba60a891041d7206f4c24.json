            "text": "To understand how health care delays may affect breast cancer detection, the authors quantified changes in breastrelated preventive and diagnostic care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Eligible women (N = 39,444) were aged \u226518 years and received a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, or breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, at 7 academic and community breast imaging facilities in North Carolina. Changes in the number of mammography or breast biopsy examinations after March 3, 2020 (the first COVID-19 diagnosis in North Carolina) were evaluated and compared with the expected numbers based on trends between January 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020. Changes in the predicted mean monthly number of examinations were estimated using interrupted time series models. Differences in patient characteristics were tested using least squares means regression. RESULTS: Fewer examinations than expected were received after the pandemic's onset. Maximum reductions occurred in March 2020 for screening mammography (\u221285.1%; 95% CI, \u2212100.0%, \u221270.0%) and diagnostic mammography (\u221248.9%; 95% CI, \u221271.7%, \u221226.2%) and in May 2020 for biopsies (\u221240.9%; 95% CI, \u221257.6%, \u221224.3%). The deficit decreased gradually, with no significant difference between observed and expected numbers by July 2020 (diagnostic mammography) and August 2020 (screening mammography and biopsy). Several months after the pandemic's onset, women who were receiving care had higher predicted breast cancer risk (screening mammography, P < .001) and more commonly lacked insurance (diagnostic mammography, P < .001; biopsy, P < .001) compared with the prepandemic population. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-associated deficits in the number of breast examinations decreased over time. Utilization differed by breast cancer risk and insurance status, but not by age or race/ethnicity. Long-term studies are needed to clarify the contribution of these trends to breast cancer disparities. Cancer 2021;0:1-11.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted daily life, including the process of seeking health care. On March 18, 2020, the US federal government advised that individuals should avoid seeking nonurgent care to minimize the risk of community-based transmission and to reserve medical resources. 1 Following suit, professional organizations, including the American College of Radiology, the Society of Breast Imaging, and the American Cancer Society, recommended that asymptomatic women forego breast cancer screening appointments. 2 As of August 2020, many states and organizations have eased recommendations on avoiding routine health care. 3 However, the pandemic remains an ongoing health crisis in the United States. Although short-term delays in receiving an imaging examination or breast biopsy may have minimal effects, extended delays may reduce the number of cancers detected at early stages, potentially increasing the number of cancer deaths in years to come. 4 Reports from May, June, and July of 2020 indicate that the use of radiologic imaging, including mammography, decreased after emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] COVID-19 has not affected all demographic subgroups equally, with higher incidence and death rates among Black and Hispanic populations and older individuals. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] If these groups perceive themselves as being at higher risk of harm from COVID-19, they may also be more likely to avoid preventive care and disproportionately more likely to experience delayed cancer diagnoses. 4 Cancer Month 0, 2021 Previous reports of COVID-19-related reductions in mammography services have focused on aggregated examination counts and/or relative value units. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In the current analysis, we provide a detailed examination of trends in screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and breast biopsy using prospectively collected, individual-level data. Furthermore, we compared the characteristics of women who received examinations before and after the onset of COVID-19 to determine which factors may have influenced the receipt of breast-related preventive care. Our hypotheses were that there would be decreases in all types of examinations during the first months of the pandemic and that the characteristics of those who continued to receive care during the pandemic would differ from the characteristics of the population observed in the pre-COVID era. These data are essential for understanding the effect of COVID-19 on delays to early breast cancer detection and diagnosis.",

The percentage change (with 95% CI) was estimated by comparing predicted means given the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic versus predicted means in the absence of the pandemic. Graphic plots of CMR data from 2010 to 2018 demonstrated seasonal fluctuations in screening mammography use, which we confirmed using the Durbin-Watson test (P = .04; data not shown). Therefore, 12th-order lagged residual terms were included in the time series models to control for seasonal variation. Examination frequencies were normalized to adjust for the various number of days in each monthly interval. 25 Differences between observed and expected trends in the postintervention period were tested using the likelihood ratio test. The number of examinations not conducted, for which the absence may have been attributed to the pandemic, was estimated by summing the difference in expected examinations during the pandemic and expected examinations in the absence of the pandemic across all time periods. Standard errors were derived using matrix operations in SAS PROC IML (SAS Institute Inc).",

Reports suggest that some are postponing routine visits, with 32% of respondents to a May 2020 survey reporting that they were overdue for preventive care. 28 Institutions across the United States have reported reductions in radiology services, including mammography. 5,7-11 However, there is a lack of data addressing the extent to which the reductions are focused on screening examinations among asymptomatic women or diagnostic procedures among women with abnormalities. It is also unclear whether certain subpopulations are more likely to experience interruptions in care. Consistent with earlier reports, 5-11 our data indicate a large reduction in mammography use after the start of the pandemic. Our maximum drop in overall mammography (76% in March 2020) was slightly lower than the 80% to 99% reductions reported by others. 5, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] Our maximum reduction in the number of breast biopsies (41% in May 2020) was lower than a 60% reduction in breast surgical consultations in April 2020 reported by others. 12 There are likely multiple factors that contributed to the drop in examinations. One reason is that patients may have stayed home because of public messaging. Initial statements from the American College of Radiology and others for individuals to postpone nonurgent care may have influenced provider and patient decision making, which resulted in canceled or delayed appointments. It is also possible that subsequent statements indicating that individuals could return to nonurgent care where safe procedures can be followed may not have had the same penetration as the initial stay home message.",

This likely reflects women receiving care as usual, plus the receipt of care by some women who delayed examinations during the first stages of the pandemic. In addition, changes in the state's operating status, the availability of personal protective equipment, symptom screening before appointments, the installation of protective barriers at health care facilities, and other social distancing measures likely contributed to the increase in examinations. Other studies have reported similar rebounds in mammography use between April and June of 2020, when other states also eased lockdown measures. 11, 29 The number of biopsies performed also increased in phase 3. The initial reduction in biopsy rates lagged behind the reduction in mammography, so it should be expected that the return to prepandemic levels would also lag behind. Somewhat counterintuitively, the proportion of biopsies completed within 7 days of an abnormal mammogram was higher during the pandemic. Potential explanations for this include fewer women using screening and diagnostic mammography services, which may have contributed to increased physician availability and a greater number of available biopsy appointment times at facilities. Although the rebounds in examination rates are reassuring, we estimate that there were still deficits of Predicted means and probabilities were estimated using a least squares random effects model to adjust for within-woman clustering.",

These 6501 screening examinations represent approximately 33 missed cancer diagnoses, 30 and there could be even more undiagnosed cancers if the diagnostic mammograms that were not conducted were linked to indications other than routine screening (eg, breast symptoms). Ongoing monitoring of these trends in the ensuing years will be crucial to understanding the long-term impact of examinations that were not conducted during the pandemic. As detailed outcome data become available, it will also be important to examine whether there are changes in the proportions of malignant, high-risk, and benign diagnoses resulting from biopsies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our data suggest that the proportion of women undergoing diagnostic evaluations who had health insurance declined after the onset of the pandemic. This is not surprising given the widespread negative economic effect of the pandemic, combined with the prevalence of employer-based health insurance plans in the United States. However, it is unclear why a similar pattern was not observed among screening mammography examinations. We observed few other demographic changes. There was some evidence that the underlying breast cancer risk of women screened may have changed with time. There is no clear explanation for why women with higher breast cancer risk were less likely to participate in screening immediately after the pandemic's onset. The change is unlikely to have been caused by older women avoiding care because we found that the mean age of women screened was relatively constant across time periods. The statistical significance of these results may be because of the study's large sample size; however, the clinical significance is unclear.",

Additional monitoring of health care use among vulnerable populations is still needed as the nature of the pandemic evolves. For example, we hypothesized that examinations might be disproportionately lower among non-White individuals if they perceived that they were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. As of November 2020, the daily number of new infections in the United States was at an all-time high and increasing rapidly. 31 Over time, those opting out of preventive and diagnostic cancer care will include a greater proportion of those actively infected with COVID-19 in addition to high-risk individuals trying to avoid exposure.

This is reassuring, given fears that delayed screenings could contribute to delayed cancer diagnoses. Our findings suggest that, if current patterns continue, the excess number of large and late-stage breast cancers related to the pandemic may be lower than expected because of the lower breast cancer risk among women who delayed screening.

The predicted mean numbers of examinations for (A) all mammograms, (B) screening mammograms, (C) diagnostic mammograms, and (D) breast biopsies conducted among participants at a subset of Carolina Mammography Registry imaging facilities were estimated using interrupted time series models. For each month after the onset of the pandemic (through September 30, 2020), the percentage change estimate compares the observed predicted mean with the expected predicted mean. Vertical lines within the histogram bars denote the 95% CIs for each estimated proportion. Trends in screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and breast biopsy before and during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic are illustrated. Time series plots show expected (solid red line) and observed (solid blue line) trends in (A) screening mammography, (B) diagnostic mammography, and (C) and breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. The number of examinations is indicated on the y-axis, and calendar time is indicated on the x-axis. The expected number of examinations was modeled based on the preintervention trend (before March 3, 2020; denoted by the vertical line).
