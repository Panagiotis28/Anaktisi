The most common type of transmission is through large respiratory droplet particles. The 2 other accepted modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are direct contact and through inhaling aerosols. 1, 2 At the beginning of the pandemic, airborne transmission was recognized only for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) in healthcare settings. Since then, the World Health Organization and the scientific community are evaluating whether SARS-CoV-2 also spreads through aerosols in the absence of AGPs, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation. 3 Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy recipients are unique populations at increased risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2. 4 Currently, limited data exist on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and optimal management of COVID-19 in this patient population. Patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 should be isolated in negative-pressure room if available or in a neutral-pressure room. 5 Our index case, a 48-year-old immunocompromised man with multiple myeloma IgA \u03ba, underwent an autologous stem-cell transplant on September 21, 2020. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a screening test 3 days later, and the cycle threshold (Ct) value was 15. He developed a high temperature and a dry cough, and a computed tomography scan demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. Treatment included convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and antibiotics. AGPs were not performed. He was discharged on October 8, and a nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR was still positive with a Ct value of 19.",

Our transplant unit's patient rooms are large rooms with closed windows, positive-pressure, and HEPA filtration, and each has an anteroom with 20 air exchanges per hour. Units must balance the risk of other major pathogens (ie, invasive molds) against the risk of COVID-19 when deciding whether the unit's airflow should be modified.
