We detected three \u03b2-CoV-positive M. javanica individuals with a positive rate of 6.98% and also detected \u03b2-CoV in two dead pangolins sampled in August 2019. The CoV carried by pangolins is a new \u03b2-CoV, which is genetically related to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was detected in eight organs of pangolins, with the highest ACE2 mRNA levels in the kidney, suggesting that these organs could be at a risk of \u03b2-CoV infection. These results enable us to better understand the status of \u03b2-CoV carried by Malayan pangolins, while providing a theoretical basis for better pangolin protection and viral control.",

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) Zhou F. et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and was defined as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. As of January 18, 2021, data from the WHO have confirmed 93,194,922 cases of COVID-19, including 2,014,729 deaths, indicating that this is a major global threat to public health. Based on whole genome sequence comparison, Bat-CoV-RaTG13 from the bat, Rhinolophus affinis, colonized in China's Yunnan province, was found to be 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could be of bat origin . However, direct contact between bats and humans is rare as discovered in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics (Drosten et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012; Cunha and Opal, 2014; Drosten et al., 2014; Sabir et al., 2016) ; therefore, it seems more likely that the virus transmission route involves a spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans through an intermediate host rather than direct transmission from bats.",

Researchers discovered a Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV) closely related to the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in a metagenomic dataset from sampled pangolins (Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Furthermore, researchers believe that pangolins have the potential to act as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, possibly from the recombination of a pangolin-CoV virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13 virus (Xiao et al., 2020) . However, whole genome sequence comparison revealed that pangolin and human viruses share 90.3% of their whole genome and that the cleavage site between S1 and S2 in SARS-CoV-2 had multiple insertions (i.e., PRRA) when compared with those of Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV-2020 (Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . Conversely, other researchers believe that pangolins may be a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs Zhang et al., 2020) ; however, there has been no evidence of coronavirus or other potentially zoonotic viral emergence from the Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) entering the wildlife trade through Malaysia (Lee et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, pangolins are currently receiving extensive attention and debate over their role as potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.",

It plays a key role in regulating the heart and kidney functions and controlling blood pressure (Ingelfinger, 2009) . In a previous study on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be the main functional receptor for the two viruses. It is likely that pangolin-CoV uses ACE2 as its receptor because pangolin-CoV-2020 has a conserved receptor-binding domain . Thus, it is important to understand which pangolin tissues are susceptible to \u03b2-CoV using ACE2 expression analysis.",

The relative mRNA expression levels in tissues relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as the lungs were 400-fold lower than those in the kidneys. Among these organs, pangolins exhibited the lowest mRNA levels in the lung, followed by the pancreas, lymph, and liver.

Although studies have suggested that bats could be natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 , how the virus accomplished cross-species transfer and propagation remainunclear. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether living pangolins carry SARS-CoV-2. The results of the 43 pangolins from Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Shaoguan revealed that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2-like virus was 6.98% in living individuals. We also detected \u03b2-CoV using RT-PCR in two dead pangolins from Guangzhou and one was also positive by metagenomic sequencing . Our research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive study on captive pangolins carrying a new coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong province. We detected coronavirus cases in healthy, symptomatic, and dead Malayan pangolins. This suggests that pangolins can carry and spread the virus; however, we cannot be certain if Malayan pangolins are natural coronavirus hosts (Tang et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen worldwide cooperation to detect coronaviruses in wild populations of Malay pangolins. Recent research has revealed that the Malayan pangolin from both Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah did not carry coronavirus or other zoonotic viruses before entering the wildlife trade. This may be attributed to the fact that they were yet to be exposed to multiple potential sources of infection (Lee et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is still necessary to detect coronaviruses in pangolins from their native countries to confirm whether pangolins are a natural host of the pangolin-CoV.",

Scientists have discovered that feces may be an important mode of transmission for some new coronaviruses carried by bats (Valitutto et al., 2020) . Similarly, we found that coronavirus was mainly present in pangolin feces, indicating that this virus may also be transmitted through feces. Although pangolins in Dongguan live together, only 3 of 22 feces were found to be positive, and their sequences had nucleic acid variations with two different genotypes. This finding indicated that this coronavirus had a limited ability to spread among individuals. Although it was weakly infectious, it is important to prevent the pangolin virus from spreading to humans through fecal transmission. Interestingly we also identified coronavirus in the lymph nodes of dead pangolins, suggesting that this virus could attack the immune system. It is likely that pangolin-CoV uses ACE2 as its receptor (Liu et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020) . ACE2 expression has been observed in multiple pangolin organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, stomach, lymph nodes, and pancreas, implying that all of these organs are at risk of infection. Similarly, ACE2 expression has also been observed in the human kidneys, respiratory tract, lungs, ileum, bladder, esophagus, and heart. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the kidneys, causing acute renal failure with severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration (Diao et al., 2020; Wadman et al., 2020) . During examination of the dead pangolin named M1 (Supplementary Table S1 ), hemorrhage of the heart, liver, and kidney was observed, which could be related to coronavirus infection.",

Recently, wild animals from Southeast Asia have been smuggled into China (Heinrich et al., 2017) , and little is known about the evolutionary status of the virus in these wild animals. However, sporadic coronavirus infections in both Guangdong and Guangxi in recent years indicate that we cannot ignore these potential hosts (Dong et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is important to monitor and understand the coronavirus spectrum carried by animals over an extended period (especially pangolins, confiscated in China), and to catalog the diversity of these viruses in their natural hosts, so that in the future we can more easily identify the host species if another coronavirus crosses into humans. This will be of great significance in protecting the health of pangolins and humans.
