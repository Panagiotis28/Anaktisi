On March 12, 2020, the French government declared national restrictions on elective surgery and gastrointestinal endoscopy for 2 months. After suspension of elective surgery, the French government reimposed restrictions on October 30, 2020. Several guidelines were rapidly published to help guide surgeons and gastroenterologists in their decision making. 1e4 A decrease in colorectal cancer screening was reported by Rutter et al, 5 among others. In their analysis of a UK nationwide database, they found a decrease up to 95% for activity in endoscopy volumes during their lockdown. Similarly, Latinga et al reported a 44% decrease in endoscopy activity after the onset of COVID-19 for colorectal cancer screening in the Netherlands. 6 However, there are no data reporting the resumption of activities in the months after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Therefore, the aim of this report was to analyze the activity after the lockdown period in the management of colorectal cancer in 2020 and its potentially significant impact on public health.",

The decreased activity has been reported in several studies. 5e7 Our results are consistent with results of other recent studies. 8 The novelty of our current report is the analysis of the post-COVID lockdown activity, which raises a public health concern. The rate of colonoscopies performed had reverted to baselines levels at the end of the pandemic lockdown. As seen in Fig 1, that of previous years during July to September, without an upsurge of activity. This observation suggests that all human and national resources were used to their maximum capacity in the postlockdown period. This finding raises a major risk for an increased rate of undiagnosed colorectal cancers. This hypothesis is particularly relevant as the indications for colonoscopy remained quite constant during the lockdown period compared to the pre-and post-COVID phases.",

The same post-COVID pandemic trend for colonoscopy was observed for colorectal surgery. No rebound of activity was reported, confirming the potentially high rate of undiagnosed colorectal cancers. In a recent study, the authors report that a 3month delay in colorectal cancer resection could be responsible for 5,000 related deaths in the United Kingdom. 9 In conclusion, post-COVID pandemic analysis is required to analyze the staging of colorectal cancers in patients diagnosed after the lockdown period. This observation could have a devastating effect, especially during subsequent waves of COVID-19 and new, although potentially less strict, lockdown mandates in France.",
