            "text": "Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a relatively common condition of varied aetiology associated with high morbidity and mortality. A range of therapies have been proven to be useful for patients with ARDS, including ventilatory and nonventilatory strategies. Prone positioning is one of the nonventilatory strategies and has been proven to be safe and is associated with significant mortality benefit in patients with moderate to severe ARDS. It is now included in several international guidelines as the standard of care for these cases. Objectives: The aim of the study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a prone positioning program in two nonmetropolitan, nontertiary intensive care units in South East Queensland. Methods: A PlaneDoeStudyeAct quality improvement model was used to implement changes in clinical practice in relation to prone positioning of patients. Results: A description of the methods used to promote a complex change strategy is provided in this article. Conclusions: In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of introducing a nonventilatory intervention of prone positioning in the management of patients with moderate to severe ARDS in regional intensive care in South East Queensland. This implementation strategy could be replicated and adopted in other similar intensive care units that do not have the ability to provide tertiary services such as extracorporeal life support.

A Cochrane systematic review identified that clinical audits lead to small but important improvement in practice. 16 However, the effectiveness of the audit depends on baseline performance, the personnel undertaking the audit, the frequency the audit is repeated, the feedback method, and the methodology used to develop and evaluate the program. Thus, clinical audits and QI programs can and do make an important contribution to knowledge and understanding about clinical problems and are increasingly being used to disseminate practice changes and improvements. However, the methodology used to implement the QI project is often not reported, and many important practice changes associated with QI initiatives are not disseminated.",

During the process of updating local ICU guidelines, we identified strong evidence recommending prone positioning for ARDS 6, 9, 11, 14, 17 and proning was not offered in our ICUs at the time. Therefore, we identified an important clinical opportunity to improve the care and outcomes of critically ill patients. Ongoing challenges arise when introducing evidence and clinical guidelines into routine daily practice. Many of these challenges are related to staff resisting guidelines or change in practice, 20 and this resistance usually stems from lack of knowledge and understanding. 21 Thus, before we implemented the PPP, we needed to understand the barriers and incentives to achieving change in practice. 22, 23 As part of the planning cycle, we formed a Proning Working Committee (PWC) that consisted of interested senior medical, nursing, and allied health members (physiotherapists, dieticians, and social workers) working in the ICUs. The first task the PWC undertook was a critical review of the relevant literature related to proning and assessing the level of evidence for the PPP. The PWC reviewed the literature, meta-analysis, and guidelines published on ARDS management over the last ten years. 6,15,16,22,24e30 Based on the findings from the review of the literature, as well as current international guidelines and procedures, the PWC planned and wrote the work unit guidelines.",

Based on observations from the simulation sessions and feedback from the participants, the PPP was modified to include pressure injury pressure adjuncts, increased number of people to assist with turning the patient, and the presence of a video laryngoscope device at the bedside to assist reintubation for accidental extubations.
