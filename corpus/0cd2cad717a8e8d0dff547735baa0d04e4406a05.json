Although insufficient to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of infection, antibody assays can be of great use for surveillance studies or for some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients presenting late to the hospital. Methods: This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 lateral flow antibody tests using 213 serum specimens from 90 PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 patients. Of 59 negative control sera, 50 were obtained from patients with other respiratory infectious diseases before COVID-19 pandemic began while nine were from patients infected with other respiratory viruses, including two seasonal coronaviruses. Results: The varied sensitivities for the four commercial kits were 70.9%, 65.3%, 45.1%, and 65.7% for BioMedomics, Autobio Diagnostics, Genbody, and KURABO, respectively, between sick days 1 and 155 in COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of the four tests gradually increased over time after infection before sick day 5 (15.0%, 12.5%, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 15.0%, and 20.0%); from sick day 11 to 15 (95.7%, 87.2%, 53.2%, and 89.4%); and after sick day 20 (100%, 100%, 68.6%, and 96.1%), respectively. For severe illness, the sensitivities were quite high in the late phase after sick day 15. The specificities were over 96% for all four tests. No cross-reaction due to other pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses, was observed.",

The infection has spread rapidly worldwide and the number of deaths is still increasing. Thus, there is an urgent need for early and reliable diagnosis, followed by appropriate medical care. Assays for viral testing, which detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or antigens, are recommended to diagnose the current COVID-19 infection. However, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) tests, which detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, require nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in many cases. This can put health care workers, who collect the samples and who transport them or perform the tests, at risk of infection, compared to when blood samples are used.",

            "text": "It is considered that the risk of infection transmission with blood samples obtained from COVID-19 patients is low, as there are no documented cases of bloodborne transmissions (1) . Serological lateral-flow assays may be beneficial from an infection transmission perspective and they are convenient, without complexity or need of a specialist. Only about 50% of COVID-19 cases were positive for molecular testing using oral swabs, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 while all cases were positive for serological tests (IgG or IgM) on day 5 of the admission in a previous study, although the number of cases was small (16 cases) (2) . Serological diagnosis is important for patients with a low viral load, which is below the detection limit of RT-PCR. This suggests that serological testing can improve the positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 when combined with PCR-based testing (3, 4) . In addition, serological antibody testing is considered useful for patients who present late in their illness and for surveillance studies (5, 6) . However, all serological assays were developed rapidly under the urgent pandemic situation, and therefore, there is limited data on their use with clinical samples. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay kit produced by many manufacturers are yet to be approved in Japan, though many tests are commercially available. We conducted this study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of four commercial immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests.",

There is bias in the distribution of sample collection days and the number of sample collection times for each patient. We had used samples that were preserved by freezing and thawing before the assays. Secondly, we could not assess the relationship between antibody tests and infected viral loads. Further study will be required to provide further understanding of the interactions between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Third, we could not evaluate the samples from COVID-19 patients, which were obtained after a long period of time had passed since the symptom onset. Only five samples were obtained over 90 days. We could not evaluate the long-term usefulness of the antibody tests. Follow-up J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f testing will be useful for evaluating antibody persistence. Lastly, we evaluated a limited number of samples infected with other pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses.",

Serological antibody tests may be inappropriate for early diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the low sensitivity result soon after symptom onset. Specificity was relatively high, as previously reported, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens in the present study. It is considered that the difference in the long-term sensitivity detection after symptom onset could affect surveillance results. We ought to understand the characteristics and limitations of antibody assays and use them in the appropriate clinical settings. Further prospective studies with larger numbers of patients and long-term observations are required.",

In the present study, we confirmed that the most and least sensitive tests were BioMedomics and Genbody, with 70.9% and 45.1%, respectively. We were unable to determine the performance superiority of IgM testing compared to IgG testing throughout the time points after symptom onset, including the early phase. Additionally, sensitivity rates gradually increased until the 11 -15 days of symptom onset and maintained a high positive percentage after day 20, especially with IgG (except for Genbody). Regarding the severity of COVID-19, samples obtained from patients with higher severity levels tended to show higher sensitivity rates, as previously reported(8). All the four kits showed good specificity (> 96%) and were considered adequate for clinical use. No cross-reactions with other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal coronaviruses, were confirmed.The immunoassay methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA), fluorescence immunoassays, and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA).

Conversely, IgG preceded IgM in 3 for BioMedomics, 1 for Autobio Diagnostics, 3 for Genbody, and 4 for KURABO out of 63 samples. This finding could be due to a possible lower production of IgM in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or the lower detection capacity (sensitivity) of the IgM test. This result suggests the need to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evaluate both IgM and IgG, and not either alone.
