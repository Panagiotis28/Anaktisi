Disasters are a fact of life that can be prepared for but not avoided. Health organizations and government agencies across the world must develop a disaster readiness mindset so that even though COVID-19 is mutating 9 and the looming possibility of future pandemics is constant, 10 the damage of these disasters can become better predicted, prevented, and controlled.",
