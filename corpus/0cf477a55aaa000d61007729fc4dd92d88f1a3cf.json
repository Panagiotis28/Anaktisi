Based on these contextual concerns, the Fear tries, pregnant women have refrained from visiting healthcare facilities for fear of infection due to hospital visits, or have felt isolated from social support networks and healthcare facilities designated for pregnant women suspected of having COVID-19. A study of pregnant Chinese women has shown that the perceived stress, depression, and anxiety of pregnant women in a pandemic situation are higher than those of normal pregnant women . On a couple level, wives' depression, anxiety, suicide intention, mental health quality of life, and preventive COVID-19 behaviors are associated with husbands' anxiety ( Ahorsu et al., 2020a ) .",

This may have been influenced by the vulnerability of pregnant women and fetuses to natural disasters and major disease outbreaks ( Favre et al., 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2016 ) and the lack of clarity about the impact of COVID-19 on the fetus ( Liang and Acharya, 2020 ; Qiao, 2020 ) . Moreover, pregnant women in Japan had higher anxiety scores than pregnant women in Iran. In Japan, companies are forcing pregnant women to go to work ( Koizumi, 2020 ) , and pregnant women living in large cities are being asked to refrain from giving birth in their hometowns ( Ichino, 2020 ) . In Japan, many pregnant women have traditional support (Satogaeri bunben); they return to their parents' homes to receive assistance for childbirth ( Ishikawa et al., 2011 ; Yoshida et al., 2001 ) . However, this support is no longer available as the pandemic has restricted the movement of people. In addition, services other than maternity care (e.g., parents' classes for group education and communication) have been withdrawn from maternity facilities to prevent infection ( Komatsu et al., 2020 ) . These findings suggest that Japanese society views pregnant women as a social risk, and that pregnant women in Japan may have shown a high level of anxiety because they are placed in an unpredictable situation where they may not receive the care they expect. In terms of factors associated with anxiety among pregnant women, the most important source of information, stockpiling, and health monitoring were found to be associated with the fear of COVID-19. Those who valued information from the Internet and social networking sites had a lower fear of COVID-19 than those who valued information from traditional media outlets such as newspapers and TV programs. For pregnant women, social networking sites and the Internet provided access to the information they need on their own. In China, antenatal health care information disseminated by hospitals using social media platforms was associated with a lower risk of stress, anxiety, and depression among pregnant women . Therefore, the use of social media in Japan as a means of disseminating antenatal health care information can decrease anxiety among pregnant women.",

For the prevention of psychological problems associated with COVID-19, it is important to have accurate knowledge and a comprehensive understanding of relevant prevention methods . Although health monitoring is an important coping strategy for both the general public and pregnant women in protecting their health, the results of this study suggest an association between health monitoring and fear of COVID-19 among pregnant women.

There is also the aspect of being able to connect with others in a similar position. It is also conceivable that if pregnant women value information from the web or social networking sites, they may place more importance on information that is uncertain but reassuring to them than on the accuracy of the information. In addition, this study did not measure the amount of time participants spend on social media, which is also likely to influence the most important source of information and the content they view.
