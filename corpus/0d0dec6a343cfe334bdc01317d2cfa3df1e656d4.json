Few studies, however, have examined the individual dispositions that influence self-regulated online learning during the coronavirus lockdown. To address this gap, the present study explored the ineffectiveness of online learning and examined how it can be predicted by self-regulated online learning and participants' procrastination disposition. Data of 433 participants were collected and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that procrastination is negatively related to 6 sub-constructs of self-regulated online learning: task strategy, mood adjustment, selfevaluation, environmental structure, time management, and help-seeking. These sub-constructs were negatively related to the learners' perceived ineffectiveness of online learning. However, the relationship between perceived learning ineffectiveness and environmental structure or help-seeking was weaker than that with task strategy or mood adjustment, indicating that the latter two subtypes of self-regulated online learning should be considered before students engage in online learning.",

Many schools have continued using distance learning approaches to offer students online learning. As an urgent response to the coronavirus pandemic, in early February 2020, all schools and universities in China stopped face-to-face teaching and started to use internet platforms to deliver online learning. This was earlier than in other countries (Dong, Cao, & Li, 2020) . Schools in China adopted the approach of \"ensuring that learning is undisrupted when classes are disrupted\" to ensure that students' learning during the pandemic lockdown period could continue. To support this new educational policy, the Chinese government provided funding to endorse online learning (Chen, Peng, et al., 2020) . However, as students had to suddenly adjust to taking many courses at home, the effectiveness of online learning during the coronavirus lockdown is still doubted (Huang et al., 2020) . For example, Bao (2020) pointed out that the effectiveness of online learning relies on students' self-directed learning attitude or personality, rather than on their ability to master the use of technological devices. Because of some level of autonomy offered in online courses, students need to exert a higher level of self-control in their online actions, for example, to overcome learner isolation and the less spontaneous online interaction which can cause procrastination in distance learning (Rasheed, Kamsin, & Abdu, 2020) . In particular, during the coronavirus lockdown, the sudden shift to online learning has presented new opportunities and unexpected challenges to the affected young children. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore an individual trait that influences learning effectiveness.",

To understand the effectiveness of online learning during the coronavirus lockdown, Zheng, Lin, and Kwon's (2020) study examined the correlation between behavior in online learning (e.g., the attendance number and amount of discussion) and learning outcomes, and compared the overall effect of online learning with traditional learning. However, few studies have focused on the factors accounting for the lack of engagement, which influences learning effectiveness due to procrastination (Michinov, Brunot, Le Bohec, Juhel, & Delaval, 2011) , especially as perceived during the coronavirus outbreak. Thus, in this study we explored how procrastination affected learners' perceptions of online learning, with a sample of college students who took online courses during the coronavirus lockdown in China.",

TAT assumes that participants have to show consistency in their thoughts and actions, initiating a more stable personality trait (Scheuble, Nieden, Leue, & Beauducel, 2019) . Procrastination as one of the stable personality traits (Van Eerde, 2003) is related to the \"voluntary delay\" of \"an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay\" (Steel, 2007, p. 66) . Using the TAT model, some studies have revealed that procrastination can intervene in self-regulated behavior (e.g., Loeffler, Stumpp, Grund, Limberger, & Ebner-Priemer, 2019; Ziegler & Opdenakker, 2018) . As TAT is extremely powerful in predicting how a person will act (Jayawickreme, Zachry, & Fleeson, 2019), it can be used to discuss the mediated-indirect effect between procrastination and online learning effectiveness (Broadbent & Poon, 2015) . Accordingly, the present study aimed to understand how procrastination was related to learning effectiveness mediated by self-regulated online learning (SROL) during the coronavirus lockdown. This study aimed to provide an insightful view to support teachers in enhancing their students' online learning during or after the coronavirus lockdown.",

Poorer executive function is related to greater procrastination (Sirois & Pychyl, 2016) . Sirois and Kitner (2015) highlighted that procrastination is positively linked with maladaptive learning strategies (e.g., denial, behavioral disengagement, etc.). The nature of procrastination is essentially \"a self-defeating behaviour pattern marked by short-term benefits and long-term costs\" (Tice & Baumeister, 1997, p. 454 ). In the academic domain, academic procrastination creates a serious barrier which prevents students' success in their school work because the goal of mastering the various educational levels is adversely affected by putting off studying the different subjects that are needed to fulfill the academic requirements (Steel, 2007) . Briefly, academic procrastination is the purposeful and unnecessary delay in completing academic tasks (Zhao & Elder, 2020) .",

Moreover, academic procrastination might have an adverse effect on homework completion (Grunschel, Patrzek, & Fries, 2012) , and even influence the decision to drop out of distance learning courses. For example, when learning at a distance, procrastinators often feel motivated to work on their course at the beginning, but then feel like dropping out after some time (Michinov et al., 2011) . These studies considered procrastination in distance learning before the coronavirus outbreak. Since the outbreak, teachers have needed to increase their use of distance online learning, but only a limited number of studies have explored the relationship in these circumstances.

            "text": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) is defined by a set of learning strategies that students undertake in order to learn (Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 2000 Zimmerman, , 2008 . Self-regulation learning (SRL) has been conceptualized in various ways in the literature. For example, students set personal learning goals, monitor their progress towards those goals, and reflect on that learning to understand if their strategies used to reach a particular goal were in fact useful (Zimmerman, 2000 (Zimmerman, , 2008 . Three distinct SRL approaches have been clustered as: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and monitoring self-regulated behavior (Li, Chen, Xing, Zheng, & Xie, 2020) . In Zimmerman's SR model, the learning process functions in three cyclical phases: forethought, performance, and selfreflection (Zimmerman & Moylan, 2009) . Learners start with the forethought phase in which they are involved with task analysis and selfmotivation (Wong, Khalil, Baars, de Koning, & Paas, 2019) . They set goals and make plans before starting work on a learning task. Selfmotivation influences these goals and plans. After the forethought phase, learners proceed to the performance phase where they fulfill their plans by exercising self-control and self-observation (Wong et al., 2019) . Additionally, they monitor their learning progress. In the self-reflection phase, learners evaluate their learning progress based on the information derived from cognitive monitoring in the performance phase and the feedback they are given. That is, they reflect on their goals, plans and strategies, and make use of this information to form new goals and plans (Wong et al., 2019) . Students with different profiles of self-regulation diverge significantly in their learning performance. For example, self-regulation led learners to outperform minimally self-regulated learners on the completeness of a design work . A previous study also specified that students who engaged carefully with the task preparation, such as by organizing appropriate information to construct connections, had more competence when involved in new situations, and continuously improved their performance of completing tasks (Irvine, Brooks, Lau, & McKenna, in press ). All these behaviors are related to forethought, adaptation and monitoring, which are considered essential components when engaging in online learning (Irvine et al., in press ). Accordingly, we define \"forethought\" as students' self-regulated behavior before they participate in online learning. Additionally, students are at an increased risk of not engaging in school work if they experience emotional maladjustment (Skinner & Pitzer, 2012) . SROL is highly influenced by the actual situation (e.g., the Wi-Fi connection) as well as by individual characteristics (e.g., mood), both of which can affect the learning outcomes (Taminiau et al., 2013) . As mood positively activates pre-reflection in SROL (Lehmann, Hahnlein, & Ifenthaler, 2014) , and the teacher-centered instructional paradigm as an approach to knowledge transmission (Rajabi, 2012) , we used mood adjustment as one of the pre-prompts to replace goal setting in SROL, which is most often required by teachers in Chinese educational culture (Bai & Wang, 2021) . Thus, the six SROL sub-constructs of task strategy, mood adjustment, self-evaluation, environmental structure, time management, and help-seeking were included in the model used in this study.",

However, other forms of procrastination exist in the psychological literature, where procrastination is deemed as \"inherently maladaptive\" (Corkin et al., 2011, p. 602 ). In the current study, we used trait-activation theory to support the research model, and used the term academic procrastination (AP) to represent inherently maladaptive procrastination as an individual trait rather than as an activator (active procrastination). Scheuble et al. (2019) posited that TAT can serve as the theoretical framework to explore how individual trait, AP, is related to perceived learning ineffectiveness (PLI) with the mediated effect of SROL: task strategy (TS), mood-adjustment (MA), self-evaluation (SE), environmental-structure (ES), time-management (TM), help-seeking (HS).

In particular, when students exhibit procrastination behaviors, the negative effects include pressure to complete the course and assignments (Alghamdi, Karpinski, Lepp, & Barkley, 2020) . Online learning systems are perceived as a valuable teaching platform on which students who engage in their online learning work using SRL strategies are inclined to achieve higher grades than their counterparts who do not do online learning (Fan, Xu, Cai, He, & Fan, 2017; Magalhaes et al., 2020) . Despite this, Panigrahi et al.'s (2018) study pointed out a mixed result of using online learning to foster learning effectiveness, due to the disposition or background of the learners. It has been noted that more self-control is required in online education as compared to traditional classroom education (Allen & Seaman, 2007) . Thus, how students' procrastination is related to their learning ineffectiveness perceptions mediated by SROL during online learning during the coronavirus outbreak period was hypothesized as follows.",

Because adolescents endorse being self-focused and tend to view external resources negatively (Daniel & Benish-Weisman, 2019) , we decided to use ineffectiveness rather than effectiveness to ask students about their perceived performance regarding their online learning.

They proposed that gender difference should be further studied in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. In the future, the gender impact should be taken into consideration.
