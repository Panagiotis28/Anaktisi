While the first two viruses only spread regionally and caused under 1000 deaths each, SARS-CoV-2 has caused almost 55 million cases and over 1.3 million deaths globally as of November 2020. The rapid succession of outbreaks necessitates research into the conserved features of coronaviruses to build upon this knowledge should yet another coronaviral disease emerge. Conserved interactions are also more likely to be essential for virus function and less likely to rapidly evolve to develop drug resistance.",

Immunostainings performed for most tagged and some untagged viral proteins found that the subcellular localization of homologous proteins is generally conserved, with some differences likely attributable to the experimental setup. As expected, the overlap of protein targets followed the evolutionary conservation, with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 being more similar to each other than to MERS-CoV, with functional groups of host interactors being more conserved than the proteins themselves. A number of non-orthologous viral proteins such as SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 and MERS-CoV Orf4a shared the same interactions, while their orthologs did not. This repurposing suggests that the host factors involved, rather than the viral interactors, may be druggable targets that could not easily be circumvented by viral plasticity.",

Twelve dependency factors were found to interact with Nsp7 of at least one of the coronaviruses, with PGES-2 interacting with all three. SARS-CoV-specific shared interactions with dependency factors included Orf8-IL17RA, Orf9b-Tom70, and Nsp6-SIGMAR1.

In Orf9b-bound Tom70 a crucial residue for the interaction with HSP90 was found shifted compared to the yeast homolog, suggesting a potential loss of this interaction. This would have far-reaching consequences, as this interaction activates TBK1/ IRF3, which is required for intracellular virus sensing through RIG-I signaling and subsequent IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 1c) . A recent study 3 found 3.5% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 to harbor predicted loss-of-function variants in interferon signaling genes, among them different autosomal dominant mutations in TBK1 and IRF3. Another study 4 identified autoantibodies against type I interferons in 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, further highlighting the important role of the innate immune system in COVID-19. While injected IFN-\u03b2 did not appear to have a benefit in the large-scale SOLIDARITY trial, a smaller study performed with inhaled IFN-\u03b2 increased the odds of clinical improvement in the treatment cohort. 5 Two further host factors interacting with viral proteins of either the two SARS viruses or all three coronaviruses and aiding its replication, PGES-2 and sigma-1, have known inhibitors that are in clinical use, allowing the study of health records for COVID-19 outcomes in patients treated with these. PGES-2 is inhibited by indomethacin, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug that is also a non-selective COX inhibitor, reducing prostaglandin synthesis through two different modes of action and supporting IFN-\u03b3-induced gene expression (Fig. 1d) . No in vitro effect of indomethacin on SARS-CoV-2 replication could be identified. For a clinical evaluation, Gordon and colleagues obtained medical billing records of 738,933 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Using the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib as control, they calculated the odds of hospitalization of outpatients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 within 21 days of starting treatment with either drug. Samples were matched using risk set sampling (RSS) based on demographic and clinical data, with further refinement using propensity score (PS) matching. Although the stringent combination of RSS and PS led to an odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization or inpatient services of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.03-3.19), the filtering based on RSS alone resulted in an OR of 0.25 (0.08-0.76). While this is certainly no conclusive proof of a benefit of indomethacin treatment to prevent hospitalization of COVID-19 patients, it is a compelling finding that warrants further research.",

While RSS alone yielded an OR of 0.56 (0.31-1.02), the matching based on RSS and PS resulted in an OR of 0.46 (0.23-0.93), demonstrating a potential benefit of typical antipsychotics in preventing the need for mechanical ventilation.",

These will have to be investigated further to assess their efficacy and safety in a clinical setting, as well as patient populations that could benefit from them. Both antipsychotics and indomethacin can have serious adverse effects. Indomethacin can interfere with hypertensive medication, thus potentially exacerbating this risk factor for COVID-19, and impair kidney function as is also observed in COVID-19. IFN-\u03b2 on the other hand may only be effective in early stages of the disease as viral clearance is mostly completed at ten days after the onset of symptoms, a time span below the average duration of mechanical ventilation in critical cases. The authors first screened for interactors with viral proteins of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (a) and then filtered these through a knockout/-down screen revealing restriction and dependency factors, respectively (b). c Proposed mechanism of action for an ORF9bmediated disruption of viral dsRNA sensing and IFN\u03b2 production. d Mechanism of action of indomethacin and the control drug celecoxib in prostaglandin synthesis",
