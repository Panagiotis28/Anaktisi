This is not a universal sarbecovirus trait; for example, many known sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-1 have two deletions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that render them incapable of using human ACE2. Here, we report three sequences of a novel sarbecovirus from Rwanda and Uganda which are phylogenetically intermediate to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate via in vitro studies that they are also unable to utilize human ACE2.",

We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the lineage including SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious; we show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario; and we propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have occurred and why it is evolutionarily advantageous. The findings provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid spread around the world demonstrates that coronaviruses (CoVs) from wildlife remain an urgent threat to global public health and economic stability. In particular, coronaviruses from the subgenus Sarbecovirus (which includes SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, numerous bat viruses, and a small number of pangolin viruses) (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 2019) are considered to be a high-risk group for potential emergence. As both sarbecoviruses that have caused human disease (SARS-CoV-1 and -2) use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their cellular receptor (Wenhui Li et al. 2003 ; P. , the evolution of this trait is of particular importance for understanding the emergence pathway for sarbecoviruses. Bat SARS-like coronavirus Rp3 is a phylogenetically close relative of SARS-CoV-1 but is unable to bind human ACE2 (hACE2) in vitro (Ren et al. 2008) . In contrast, other close relatives of SARS-CoV-1, including bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 and WIV16, do have the capacity to bind hACE2 (Ge et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2016) . A number of other SARS-CoV-1like viruses have also been tested for their ability to utilize hACE2 (Hu et al. 2017; Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020; Menachery et al. 2015 ) and comparison of their spike protein sequences shows that viruses that are unable to utilize hACE2 unanimously have one or two deletions in their RBDs that make them structurally very different than those that do use hACE2 (Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020) . As SARS-CoV-1, Rp3, WIV1, and WIV16 viruses are closely phylogenetically related, the evolutionary mechanism explaining the variation in their ability to utilize hACE2 (and likely also bat ACE2) as a cellular receptor has thus far been unclear.",

Bats within this family are also considered to be the source of the progenitor virus to SARS-CoV-1, as related viruses with high sequence identity to SARS-CoV-1 have been sequenced from Rhinolophid bats, although none have high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1 across the entire genome (Hu et al. 2017; Hon et al. 2008) . It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-1 obtained genomic regions from different strains of bat SARS-1-like CoVs in or near Yunnan Province by recombination before spilling over into humans (Hu et al. 2017; Luk et al. 2019; Hon et al. 2008) . In particular, one region of SARS-CoV-1 that is known to have a recombinant origin is the spike gene, as a breakpoint has been detected at the junction of ORF1b and the spike (Hon et al. 2008; Lau et al. 2010) . The SARS-1-CoV spike is genomically very different from other viruses in the same clade that have large deletions in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and are unable to use hACE2. The exact minor parent that contributed the recombinant region is still unknown, but it was previously hypothesized that the recombination occurred with a yet undiscovered lineage of sarbecoviruses and that this event contributed strongly to its potential for emergence (Hon et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2010 ). Recombination has also been shown within the spike genes of other CoVs that have spilled over into humans and domestic animals and is potentially an important driver of emergence for all coronaviruses (Graham and Baric 2010; Su et al. 2016; Menachery, Graham, and Baric 2017; Woo et al. 2009; G.

Yu et. al showed that there are three lineages of SARS-CoV-1-like viruses: Lineage 1 from southwestern China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, and including SARS-CoV-1), Lineage 2 from other southern regions (Guangdong, Hubei, Hong Kong, and Zhejiang), and Lineage 3 from central and northern regions (Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Jilin) (Yu et al. 2019) .

Sarbecoviruses appear to switch easily among co-occurring Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 cannot be guaranteed to have emerged from bats in Hubei Province, as humans are highly mobile and the exact spillover event was not observed. If the clade containing SARS-CoV-2 and its close relatives is indeed endemic in animals in Yunnan and the nearby Southeast Asian regions as suggested by the presence of RaTG13, RmYN02, and the natural range of the Malayan pangolin, whatever mechanism is facilitating the biogeographical concordance of Lineages 1, 2 and 3 within China appears to no longer apply for the biogeography of Lineage 5, since they all appear to overlap in and around Yunnan Province.",

We also report three fulllength genomes of sarbecoviruses from Rwanda and Uganda and demonstrate that the RBDs of these viruses are genetically intermediate between viruses that use ACE2 and those that do not. Accordingly, we also investigate the potential for these viruses to utilize hACE2 in vitro. Together, our findings help illuminate the evolutionary history of ACE2 usage within sarbecoviruses and provide insight into identifying their risk of emergence in the future. We also propose a mechanism that could explain the pattern of phylogeography across Lineages 1, 2, and 3, and why Lineage 5 viruses (including SARS-CoV-2 and its relatives) represent an inconsistency to this pattern.",

            "text": "To better understand the evolutionary history of sarbecoviruses we first constructed a phylogenetic tree of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, also known as nsp12 (Figure 1 ). The tree was constructed using sequences from GenBank as well as three sequences of a novel sarbecovirus detected in bats from Uganda and Rwanda as part of the USAID-PREDICT project. The three novel sequences share >99% nucleotide identity to each other and ~76% and ~74% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Phylogenetically, they lie within Lineage 4, clustering with previously reported SARS-related coronavirus BtKY72 found in bats in Kenya (Tao and Tong 2019) and bat coronavirus BM48-31 from Bulgaria (Drexler et al. 2010) . The topology of the sarbecovirus phylogeny is uncertain with respect to the placement of the Lineage 4 viruses, with some models placing them between Lineage 5 and Lineages 1, 2, and 3, and others placing them at the base of the tree, depending on the methodology and alignment used (P. Gorbalenya et al. 2020; Boni et al. 2020) (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Our results place Lineage 4 in the former position with high posterior support for the RdRp gene, though the variability in this placement must be recognized. Figure 1 also demonstrates the same geographic pattern of concordance reported by Yu et al (Yu et al. 2019) , where viruses in each lineage show a clear pattern of fidelity with particular geographic regions. However, SARS-CoV-2 does not lie within the clade of bat sarbecoviruses that have been detected in bats in China to date but rather forms a much deeper, separate lineage. The discovery of the \"Lineage 5\" clade containing SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in pangolins and bats is a deviation from the geographic patterns observed for other sarbecoviruses.",

Interestingly, bat virus RmYN02 is no longer associated with SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD and is instead within the clade of non-ACE2-using viruses. We also found that within the RBD, ACE2-using viruses and non-ACE2-using viruses are perfectly phylogenetically separated. The viruses from Africa and Europe form a distinct clade that is intermediate between the ACE2-using and non-ACE2-using groups, but appears more closely related to the ACE2-using group.",

Thus, to determine the ability of these sarbecoviruses to use hACE2 and better delineate the boundaries of ACE2 usage, we performed in vitro experiments in which we replaced the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 with the RBD from the Uganda (PDF-2370, PDF-2386) and Rwanda viruses (PRD-0038) (Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020) .

However, modeling the interaction with hACE2 reveals amino acid differences at key interfacial positions that can help explain the lack of interaction observed for the rVSV-Uganda and rVSV-Rwanda viruses ( Figure 4B -C). There are four regions of the RBD that lie within 10\u00c5 of the interface with hACE2, one of which is the receptor binding ridge (SARS-CoV-1 residues 459-477) that is critical for hACE2 binding (Prabakaran, Xiao, and Dimitrov 2004; Shang et al. 2020) .

F. Li 2008; K. Wu et al. 2012 ). All sarbecoviruses from Africa contain a Lys (K) at SARS-CoV-1 position 479 within region 3 (positions 481 and 482 for Uganda and Rwanda, respectively), which makes contact with these ACE2 hotspots (as compared to N479 or Q493 in SARS-CoV-1 and 2 respectively; Figure 4C ). K479 decreases binding affinity by more than 20-fold in SARS-CoV-1 (Wenhui . The negative contribution of K479 in region 3 is likely due to unfavorable electrostatic contributions with ACE2 hotspot K31 ( Figure 4C ) (F. Li 2008; Wan et al. 2020b ). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-1 residue T487 (N501 in SARS-CoV-2) interacts with ACE2 hotspot K353 and has a Val (V) in the viruses from Africa (residues 489 and 490) ( Finally, the receptor binding ridge, which is conspicuously absent from all non-ACE2 binders, is present in the sarbecoviruses from Africa but has amino acid variations that differ significantly from both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 5 ). Changes in the structure of this ridge contribute to increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, as a Pro-Pro-Ala (PPA) motif in SARS-CoV-1 (residues 469-471) replaced with Gly-Val-Glu-Gly (GVEG) in SARS-CoV-2 results in a more compact loop and better binding with hACE2 (Shang et al. 2020) . Changes within this ridge may be negatively contributing to hACE2 binding of viruses from Africa, which have Ser-Thr-Ser-Gln (STSQ) or Ser-Iso-Ser-Gln (SISQ) in this position ( Figure 4C and 5).",

The specific bat host species for the Uganda and Rwanda viruses reported here could not be definitively identified in the field or in the lab, but are all genetically identical. They may represent a cryptic species, as the mitochondrial sequences are ~94% identical with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and ~96% identical with Rhinolophus clivosus in the cytochrome b (cytb) gene, each of which have been deposited in GenBank (accessions MT738926-MT738928, MT732776). We were also able to extract ACE2 sequences from the deep sequencing reads of PDF-2370 (GenBank accession MW183243) to compare it to ACE2 sequences from species that are known to host ACE2 binders (human, civet, pangolin), non-ACE2 binders (R. macrotis, pearsonii, pusillus, ferrumequinum), and both (R. sinicus). Comparison of the ACE2 sequences shows that they are highly similar, with only a few amino acids that are changed in hosts of viruses that utilize ACE2 compared to the host of our African bat sample (Supplementary File 1). R. sinicus in particular is a known host of viruses that utilize ACE2 as well as viruses with the deletions that do not, suggesting that adaptation to divergent bat ACE2 is not a likely explanation for the deviation in sequence and structure of the RBD of viruses with deletions, including the novel sarbecoviruses from Uganda and Rwanda. These findings provide additional structural evidence that aids in distinguishing viruses which bind ACE2 from those that do not. They also demonstrate that ACE2 usage within sarbecoviruses is restricted to those viruses within the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 clade in the RBD (Lineages 1 and 5, Figure 2 ).",

When mapped to the RdRp tree, the 'extra' RBD sequence present in the ACE2-using viruses is conspicuous within the Lineage 1 clade of otherwise non-ACE2-using viruses that have large deletions. We also note that there are two distinct groups of RBD sequences within ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses: Type 1, containing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-SZ3 (civet), Rs3367, WIV1, Rs7327, YN2018B, Rs9401, WIV16, Rs4874, and LYRa11, and Type 2, containing Rs4231, Rs4084, and RsSHC014. Further, RmYN02 is within the Lineage 5 clade of ACE2-using viruses in RdRp but its RBD sequence contains both deletions ( Figure 5 ). Without recombination, the viruses with deletions in region 2 and in the receptor binding ridge would have had to be gained and lost in precisely the same positions for ACE2-using Lineage 1 viruses and RmYN02, respectively, which is not a parsimonious explanation. The phylogeny and sequence in Figure 5 also illustrate that ACE2-usage appears to be an ancestral trait conserved in Lineage 5 (Boni et al. 2020 ) and a derived trait in each of the 13 Lineage 1 viruses with ACE2-using structure.",

This suggests that a WIV1/Rs3367-like Type 1 virus which had already undergone recombination in regions B through E underwent a second recombination event with a Type 2 virus on top of the first in region E. A number of other viruses also appear to have recombinant history in regions B, C, and D (SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21, YN2013, Anlong-103, and Anlong 112), but these viruses do not show evidence of recombination that spans the RBD in region E, which contains the amino acid deletions in region 2 and the receptor binding ridge and appears to primarily determine ACE2-using potential. The frequency of recombination in this region among Lineage 1 viruses strongly supports the hypothesis that after ACE2usage was acquired in Lineage 1, it subsequently spread throughout the clade via additional recombination events with other Lineage 1 viruses.",

Using tip dating in BEAST2, we constructed a time-calibrated phylogeny for RdRp using a substitution rate prior inferred from Boni et al. 2020 (Boni et al. 2020 . Using the RdRp tree as an evolutionary backbone, the deletions in region 2 and the receptor binding ridge of the RBD appear to have been lost in a stepwise fashion ( Figure 5 ). The small deletion in region 2 likely arose first, before the diversification of Lineage 4 in Africa and Europe ( Figure 5 ) and was dated using the MRCA of Lineages 1, 2, 3 and 4 ( Figure 8 ). Alternatively, as the boundaries of the deletion in region 2 in Lineage 4 and Lineages 1, 2, and 3 do not align perfectly and there is uncertainty in the position of this branch in the phylogeny, it is equally possible that this deletion was lost independently in Lineage 4. The larger deletion in the receptor binding ridge, not present in known sequences from Lineage 4, likely arose second, but before the diversification of Lineages 1, 2, and 3 ( Figure 5 ) and was dated with the MRCA of these three lineages ( Figure 8 ). Because no ACE2-using viruses have been discovered in Lineage 2 or 3 to date, we propose that the re-appearance of this trait arose after the MRCA of Lineage 1 on the tree ( Figure 8 ). As SARS-CoV-1 was the earliest Lineage 1 virus sequenced with ACE2-using structure, the emergence of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 must have occurred in the time between the MRCA of Lineage 1 (1852, 95% HPD 1804-1901) and the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003.",

To account for variability in lineage-specific substitution rates, we also generated a time-calibrated model using a relaxed lognormal clock (Figure 7 ). Comparing the time-calibrated RBD tree to the time-calibrated RdRp tree, the divergence dates for the two types of RBD sequence observed in the recombinant Lineage 1 sequences are incompatible, suggesting that more than one recombination event donating ACE2 usage from Lineage 5 to Lineage 1 must have occurred. The 13 Lineage 1 recombinants (both Type 1 and Type 2) coalesce between 119-216 years ago in RdRp and between 259-490 years ago in the RBD (Figure 7 ). If these time estimates reflect true rates of diversification, a single introduction of the ACE2-using phenotype via recombination would not allow enough time for the sequence divergence between Type 1 and Type 2 RBDs to accumulate, even when accounting for the substitution rate in RBD being estimated as an order of magnitude higher than that of RdRp (5.248e-4 in RdRp, 2.181e-3 in RBD). Further, the substitution rate that would be needed for the observed sequence divergence in the RBD of the 13 recombinants to have accumulated since their MRCA in RdRp (1852) is more than double the estimated rate of our timecalibrated tree (5.899e-3). Even with a relaxed clock assumption, the maximum value of the posterior distribution of the mean rate is only 4.733e-3. From this, we conclude that two independent recombination events occurred between Lineage 5 and Lineage 1 resulting in two distinct RBD types.",

The recombination hypothesis posits that two recombination events donated Type 1 and Type 2 RBD sequence from Lineage 5 to Lineage 1; however, these two events are insufficient to explain the non-monophyletic pattern of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1. We further hypothesize that whichever Lineage 1 virus first gained Type 1 and Type 2 ACE2 usage in each group then donated the trait to other Lineage 1 viruses through subsequent recombination events ( Figure 8 ). It is difficult to approximate a date for such an event, but the MRCA of the Type 1 recombinants in the RBD may be a close estimation (between 42 and 77 years ago) (Figure 7) . The events must have been recent enough that the observed diversity of Type 2 RBD sequences is quite low, yet not so recent such that there would not have been time for recombination to have occurred twice in region E for sequences Rs4084 and RsSHC014 ( Figure 6B ).",

Because no viruses demonstrating ACE2 usage have been discovered in Lineages 2, 3, and 4, this would mean that the ACE2 usage trait would have been lost via deletion in these lineages. Further, because of the nonmonophyletic branching order of these lineages, this would require multiple independent and identical losses of the region 2 and receptor binding ridge deletions in all three of these lineages. If this did indeed occur, in order to then observe the pattern of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1 where some viruses, but not all, have the ACE2 usage trait, further independent losses would be required in individual viruses. In much the same manner as convergence would require multiple independent and identical events, persistence of ACE2 usage with multiple independent deletions for the entire clades of Lineages 2, 3, and 4 and only some of the viruses in Lineage 1 is also highly non-parsimonious. Persistence is also a poor explanation for the pattern of the two RBD types observed, particularly for Type 2, where the RBD sequences are highly similar but the RdRp sequences are quite divergent. If both genes were vertically inherited via persistence, we would expect these genes to have approximately equal MRCA ages. Instead, we observe that the MRCA age for Type 2 RBDs in region E are much younger than for RdRp.",

This naturally leads to the hypothesis that ACE2 usage arose independently in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 via convergent evolution. This has been suggested previously for another ACE2-using human coronavirus, NL63 ). However, a phylogeny constructed using the RBD perfectly separates viruses that have been shown to utilize ACE2 from those that do not ( Figure 2 ). Viruses that cannot utilize ACE2 have significant differences in their RBDs, including large deletions in critical interfacial residues and low amino acid identity with viruses that do use ACE2 ( Figure 5) . Notably, in addition to the large deletions, viruses that cannot use ACE2 deviate considerably at the interacting surface, including positions that play fundamental roles dictating binding and cross-species transmission (Wan et al. 2020a; F. Li et al. 2005; Shang et al. 2020) . It is unknown whether viruses that cannot use hACE2 are utilizing bat ACE2 or an entirely different receptor altogether, but since mammalian ACE2 is so conserved (Damas et al. 2020; S. D. Lam et al. 2020 ) and ACE2-using viruses demonstrate broad host tropism (Hou et al. 2010; Zheng et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020; F. Li 2008) , we hypothesize that there is likely a different receptor involved for the non-ACE2 users (see Supplementary File 1).",

As there are two types of closely related RBD sequences in the recombinant Lineage 1 viruses ( Figure 2 ) with incompatible divergence dates (Figure 7) , we suggest that two such recombination events occurred between Lineage 1 and Lineage 5 ( Figure 8) independently introducing ACE2-usage into Lineage 1. The non-monophyletic nature of ACE2 usage within Lineage 1 can then be most parsimoniously explained by secondary intra-lineage recombination events ( Figure 8 ). It is possible that both hypotheses are partially true and that both intra-lineage recombination as well as the persistence of this trait alongside sister Lineage 1 viruses without the trait gave rise to the observed patterns of Type 1 and Type 2 ACE2 usage within Lineage 1. It is also very possible that further sampling may illuminate that some of the events proposed here have been distorted by sampling bias. We have estimated that these events may have occurred roughly within the last two centuries, though this estimate will likely change with further sampling as well. Our intention is not necessarily to date these events exactly, but rather to infer their order relative to each other and to make hypotheses based on this order of events. Confidence intervals for many node dates overlap, but high posterior probabilities on internal nodes indicate that events most likely occurred in a certain order.",

According to the branching order shown here, the smaller deletion in region 2 was likely acquired earliest, before the diversification of the clades into Africa and Europe, since it is shared by all clades with the exception of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage 5 at the base of the tree ( Figure 5 ). These large deletions in the RBD-ACE2 interface and the similarity of Rhinolophid and hACE2 also suggest that non-ACE2-using viruses, including Lineages 1, 2, 3, and 4, are using at least one receptor other than ACE2 (Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020; H.

In contrast, human coronavirus NL63 is an alphacoronavirus that is also a hACE2 user but most likely represents a true case of convergent evolution.

We also highlight an additional unreported recombination event between Lineage 5 and Lineage 1 giving rise to RmYN02 that further demonstrates the importance of this evolutionary mechanism. We observed that the Lineage 5 bat virus RmYN02, which is highly similar to SARS-CoV-2 within the RdRp, actually has a RBD with the Lineage 1 deletion trait associated with the inability to use ACE2. This indicates a recombination in the opposite direction, From Lineage 1 to Lineage 5, and is again consistent with their overlapping host and geographic ranges. The RmYN02 virus was sequenced from a pooled sample that also contained a second strain, RmYN01, so the possibility that the assembled RmYN02 sequence is chimeric cannot be ruled out. However, both RmYN01 and RmYN02 have deletions in the RBD, so whether or not the sequence is chimeric, it is most likely still recombinant.",

However, the co-circulation of these distantly phylogenetically related viruses is a notable deviation from previous observations that show sarbecovirus phylogeny mirrors geography. It is unknown why Lineages 1-4 show strong phylogeographic clustering. Isolation by distance (IBD) is one ecological mechanism that could explain concordance between phylogeny and geography; however, this would not explain why Lineage 5 deviates from this pattern and overlaps geographically with Lineage 1. Instead, we hypothesize that immune cross-reactivity between closely related viruses within hosts results in indirect competitive exclusion and priority effects, and that this explains the phylogeographic signal of Lineages 1-3. Antibodies against the spike protein are critical components of the immune response against CoVs (Buchholz et al. 2004; L. Lu et al. 2004; Prabakaran et al. 2006) . Hosts that have been infected by one sarbecovirus may be immunologically resistant to infection from a related sarbecovirus, leading to geographic exclusion of closely related strains and a pattern of evolution that is concordant with geography despite the fact that species and individuals are not strictly confined (Figure 1 ). It is unlikely that this pattern is caused by differing competencies amongst Rhinolophus bats, as host-switching of these viruses appears to be common. The co-circulation of Lineage 5 viruses (including SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses) in the same species and the same geographic location as Lineage 1 viruses may suggest a release in the competitive interactions maintaining geographic specificity. This would preclude recognition by cross-reactive antibodies, such as those produced against the spike protein, and may be evolutionarily advantageous for the recombinant virus.",

If this holds true, it would support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 originated in Yunnan or the surrounding regions of southwest China before the initial epidemic then amplified in Wuhan. Southeast Asia and parts of Europe and Africa have been previously identified as hotspots for sarbecoviruses (Anthony, Johnson, et al. 2017 ), but increased surveillance will help characterize the true range of ACE2-using sarbecoviruses in particular. The receptors for viruses from northern China and other regions such as Europe and Africa remain unknown, and may not pose a threat to human health if they cannot utilize hACE2, though their potential to acquire hACE2-usage by recombination should be considered along with the potential for their existing spike proteins to use other human receptors for cell entry. It is unclear whether the lack of hACE2 binding for sarbecoviruses from Uganda and Rwanda is due to the small deletion in region 2 or to the numerous amino acid changes in other interfacial residues. It is possible that sarbecoviruses in Africa with different residues in these interfacial regions could potentially still use hACE2. It is also unknown whether the sarbecoviruses from Africa in particular use a different receptor altogether, or whether sarbecoviruses with the potential to utilize hACE2 without the region 2 deletion have also diversified into Africa or Europe. If competitive release between groups of viruses utilizing different receptors has indeed occurred, further surveillance is needed to determine the true extent of Lineage 5 viruses. In addition, experimental evidence to support or refute a competitive release hypothesis should be prioritized.",

            "text": "This study highlights that hACE2 usage is unpredictable using phylogenetic proximity to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 in the RdRp gene. This is due to vastly different evolutionary histories in different parts of the viral genome due to recombination. Phylogenetic relatedness in the RdRp gene is not an appropriate proxy for pandemic potential among CoVs (the 'nearest neighbor' hypothesis). By extension, the consensus PCR assays most commonly used for surveillance and discovery, which mostly generate a small fragment of sequence from within this gene (Quan et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2010; De Souza Luna et al. 2007) , are insufficient to predict hACE2 usage. Using phylogenetic distance in RdRp as a quantitative metric to predict the potential for emergence is tempting because of the large amount of data available, but this approach is unlikely to capture the biological underpinnings of emergence potential compared to more robust data sources such as full viral genome sequences. The current collection of fulllength sarbecovirus genomes is heavily weighted toward China and Rhinolophus hosts, despite evidence of sarbecoviruses prevalent outside of China (such as in Africa) and in other mammalian hosts (such as pangolins). Further, investigations into determinants of pathogenicity and transmission for CoVs and the genomic signatures of such features will be an important step towards the prediction of viruses with spillover potential, and distinguishing those with pandemic potential. https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/vevolu Finally, these findings reiterate the importance of recombination as a driver of spillover and emergence, particularly in the spike gene. If SARS-CoV-1 gained the ability to use hACE2 through recombination, other non-ACE2-using viruses could become human health threats through recombination as well. We know that recombination occurs much more frequently than just this single event with SARS-CoV-1, as the RdRp phylogeny does not mirror host phylogeny and the RBD tree has significantly different topology across all geographic lineages. In addition, the bat virus RmYN02 appears to be recombinant in the opposite direction (Lineage 5 backbone with Lineage 1 RBD) (H. , again supporting the hypothesis that recombination occurs between these lineages. Our analyses support two hypotheses: first, that sarbecoviruses frequently undergo recombination in this region of the genome, resulting in this pattern, and second, that sarbecoviruses are commonly shared amongst multiple host species, resulting in a lack of concordance with host species phylogeny and a reasonable opportunity for coinfection and recombination. Bats within the family Rhinolophidae have also repeatedly shown evidence of introgression between species (Mao, Zhang, and Rossiter 2016; Mao, He, et al. 2013; Mao et al. 2014; Mao, Thong, et al. 2013; Mam et al. 2010; Dool et al. 2016) , supporting the hypothesis that many species in this family have close contact with one another which may facilitate viral host switching. Given that we have shown that ACE2-using viruses are co-occurring with a large diversity of non-ACE2-using viruses in Yunnan Province and in a similar host landscape, recombination poses a significant threat to the emergence of novel sarbecoviruses (Hu et al. 2017 ).",

The prior distribution for the coalescent population size was set to lognormal with mean 1 and standard deviation 10 to help with convergence, as the default of 1/X is an improper prior. Our phylogenetics and time estimates are in accordance with those proposed by Boni et al (Boni et al. 2020) . As the substitution rate in the spike gene is undoubtedly higher than in RdRp, the same clock rate prior could not be used for the Region E time-calibrated phylogeny because the divergence dates would not be comparable. Instead, we assumed the age of the root of this tree should be approximately the same as the age of the Region A tree and fixed the tree height to match the posterior estimate of the tree height for Region A (770 years before present, 1250 AD). This was done by adding a monophyletic MRCA prior to all taxa with a Laplace distribution with mu 1250 and scale 0.1. To account for lineage-specific substitution rates, we also tested a relaxed lognormal clock model.",

Breakpoint-free regions A and E from Figure 6 were chosen for time calibration since evidence of recombination was found in both RdRp and RBD. Both regions A and E were free of recombination for all sequences included in the tree, ensuring the best possible dating estimates. The MRCA of all Lineage 1 recombinants and its corresponding divergence date are labeled on each tree, demonstrating that the MRCA in region E (within the RBD) is much older than the MRCA in region A (proxy for RdRp, see Figure 6 ). This suggests that there would not have been enough time for the RBDs of the recombinants to diversify to the extent shown here if only a single recombination event occurred between Lineage 5 and Lineage 1. The MRCAs of each type are labeled in red (Type 1) and purple (Type 2). Posterior distributions of rate estimates are also shown for each model as well as for a relaxed clock model of region E. For the observed sequence divergence in region E to have accumulated since the MRCA of the 13 recombinants in region A (1852), a clock rate of 5.899e-3 would be required, which is well outside the posterior distributions estimated by both our strict and relaxed clock models. Figure 8 . Proposed timeline of deletion and recombination events. The timeline demonstrates the sequence of events that led to loss of ACE2 usage in Lineages 2, 3, and 4 and gain of ACE2 usage within Lineage 1, leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-1. Events are dated with MRCA age estimates; however, the exact intention is less to provide exact dates and more to suggest a particular order of events, which is strongly supported by the posterior probabilities of the time-calibrated phylogenies. The arrow for the Lineage 4 event is again dashed to demonstrate uncertainty in its positioning. We illustrate two hypotheses for the acquisition and subsequent spread of ACE2 usage in Lineage 1: recombination and persistence. The recombination hypothesis is much more parsimonious, as persistence would require multiple independent deletion events to generate the observed pattern of ACE2 usage. Figure 1 : Phylogenetic tree of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (nsp12) and associated geographic origin and host species. Colors of clade bars represent the different geographic lineages. Lineage 1 is shown in blue, Lineage 2 in green, and Lineage 3 in orange. The clade of viruses from Africa and Europe is putatively named \"Lineage 4\" and is shown in purple. The phylogeny shows strong posterior support for the branching order presented; however, different models or genes have produced trees with different branching orders placing Lineage 4 outside Lineage 5, so the branch to Lineage 4 is dashed to represent this uncertainty (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The putative \"Lineage 5\" containing SARS-CoV-2 is also shown in blue at the bottom of the tree to demonstrate that the sequences are from the same regions as Lineage 1 viruses. The geographic origin of each virus is indicated by the lines that terminate in the respective country or province with the same color code. The full province and country names for all two-and three-letter codes can be found in Table 1 . As human, civet, and pangolin viruses cannot be certain to have naturally originated in the province in which they were first found, their locations are not illustrated, but the natural range of the pangolin (Manis javanica) is denoted with dashed shading and the origins of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 human outbreaks are designated with red stars in Guangdong and Hubei, respectively. Hosts are also shown with colored symbols according to the key on the left. The host phylogeny in the key was adapted from (Agnarsson et al. 2011) . The root of the tree was shortened for clarity.",

The presence of a hydrophobic residue at position 487, not previously observed in any ACE2 binding sarbecovirus, might lead to a local rearrangement at the K353 hotspot that hinders hACE2 binding. Indeed, most non-ACE2 binders have a Val (V) in SARS-CoV-1 position 487 (Figure 5).",
