            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of COVID-19. It is one of the three highly pathogenic members of the family of coronaviridae. 1 Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a range of hallmarks that progress from mild to severe clinical presentations before terminating in death in less than 10% of cases. 2 The WHO has recommended RT-PCR as the gold standard protocol for screening individuals with typical symptoms who are suspected of having COVID-19. Although appropriate use of RT-PCR provides very accurate results, test reagents and consumables are mostly in short supply. Besides, this protocol is laborious, expensive to operate, requiring technical expertise and it has a long test turnaround time. Also, one of the major technical drawbacks in using RT-PCR is the significant number of cases of false-negative results, despite patients having clinical features and radiologic findings that are highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The false-negative results could be due to wrong sampling, where SARS-CoV-2 might have been present in the lower respiratory tract rather than upper respiratory tract samples often collected for laboratory diagnosis. This poses a challenge in the proper evaluation of some SARS-CoV-2-infected people. 3 It has been observed that the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have made it an arduous task and challenge in the control of the pandemic, despite WHO-proposed measures having already been introduced. 4 Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously challenged the operation of the entire healthcare system, including hospitals, laboratory diagnosis, the management of patients and every other aspect of human endeavor. 5, 6 In the quest to augment several lapses in the use of RT-PCR testing for COVID-19, serological assays that detect and /or measure antibodies (immunoglobulins) against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed and evaluated for performance by many institutions and private biotechnology firms. Global efforts to scale up the testing and diagnosis of COVID-19 has led to the commercial production of serological kits and devices. Some of these products have gained executive approval in some countries. For instance, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave expedient approval for some COVID-19 serological kits based on their accuracy and reliability. 7 Instances have arisen where massive production and the use of finger-prick assays and in vitro testing have been encouraged in the UK and the USA to scale up COVID-19 surveillance through rapid testing and measurement of either antigens or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. These rapid testing protocols adopted in these countries are point-of-care testing (POCT), which are designed as lateral flow devices (colloid gold-based immunochromatographic cassettes or test strips) with a diverse range of performance characteristics. These devices require a small sample volume (in microliters), are conducted within a short period (a few seconds to minutes), and are easier to perform as their use requires less technical expertise and equipment compared with protocols that detect nucleic acid. 8 The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic make it very challenging to control despite measures put in place in various countries of Africa and elsewhere outside the continent. Adequate laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 plays a highly significant role in the control and prevention of the pandemic. However, some of the emerging challenges of testing for SARS-CoV-2 generally include sourcing personal protective equipment, low human capacity, scaling up testing, overwhelming contact tracing and inadequate hospital capacity to accommodate COVID-19 patients, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Hence, improved testing capacity, adequate provision of human and material resources, combined with innovative ways of scaling up contact tracing and improved testing capacity, are essential in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "There is ongoing research into better understanding the viral genome assembly, replication and mutation of SARS-CoV-2. These viral attributes drastically influence the diagnostic performance of both molecular and serological assays as well as the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and its immune responses. 14 Prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, an unexposed individual was expected to have a negative test for either anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG (Figure 1 ). However, following exposure to the infection, SARS-CoV-2 now induces a humoral immune response, which commences with the development of IgM, indicating an acute or ongoing infection from the third day of the first week of infection, as reflected by a positive outcome in either the IgM or IgM/IgG serological test. 15 The level of IgM in an individual with the activated humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise until it peaks during the third week following infection. 15 By the end of the third week, IgM levels decrease with a concomitant elevation in the level of IgG from the third to the seventh week post symptom onset (PSO), which is revealed by a positive outcome in either the IgG or IgM/IgG serological test ( Figure 2 ). 15 The median period for the development of all the classes of immunoglobulins following the activation of humoral immune response is 13 d. 16 Individually, IgM, IgG and total immunoglobulins have an average duration of 11, 12 and 14 d, respectively. 16 These immunoglobulins can be measured and monitored by a diverse range of antibody-based serological testing techniques, which include rapid diagnostic assay (e.g. lateral flow immunoassay [LFIA] with colloidal gold], CLIA, ELISA and neutralization assay with various diagnostic performance ratings (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV), sampling methods (e.g. finger prick, venipuncture), turnaround time and setting. 16 Previous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic roles of these antibody-based serological testing techniques based on their performance. Zhao et al. 17 demonstrated that within the first 7 d PSO of COVID-19 infection, the sensitivity of total antibody, IgM and IgG were 38.3%, 28.7% and 19.1%, respectively, which was lower compared with the RNA-based test of 66.7% sensitivity. As the duration of PSO increased, the sensitivity of the RNA-based test decreased by 21.2%, while those of the total antibody, IgM and IgG increased by 61.7%, 65.6% and 60.78%, respectively, within the 15th to 39th day PSO. When the RNA-and antibodybased tests were combined, sensitivity significantly improved to 78.7%, 97.0% and 100% within 1-7, 8-14 and 15-39 d PSO, respectively. The implication of this study indicates the unreliability and unsuitability of serology within the window period of infection, but also reveals an impressive sensitivity for total antibodybased assay in detection of SARS-CoV-2 as the PSO period progresses.",

[18] [19] [20] The changes of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 are presently under study, as antibodies may be regarded as potent diagnostic tools to complement RT-PCR-based findings. The SARS-CoV-triggered humoral S-and N-specific IgM response reached a climax within 4 wk and was no more detectable at 3 mo PSO; the switch to IgG often occurred about day 14 and IgG were demonstrated up to 36 mo. 21, 22 In another study, the authors demonstrated that in 34 SARS-CoV-2 laboratories established, the cases studied were positive for IgM and IgG at week 3 PSO. 15 Therefore, in the majority of those patients, the acute phase of infection persisted for >30 d. In an inverse relation, as IgM levels decrease, IgG levels rise gradually from the third to the seventh week, signifying the activation of the humoral immune response against the virus. 15 Thus, the humoral response activated by SARS-CoV-2 may be similar to that elicited by SARS-CoV. 15, 16 In an immunodynamics study reported by Zhao et al., 17 it was observed that the antibody profile in COVID-19 patients showed that seroconversion sequentially appeared for total antibodies, IgM and IgG with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 d, respectively. Full concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected by double recombinant antigen sandwich immunoassay, which utilized the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 protein and the horse raddish peroxidase-conjugated antigen; IgM \u03bc-chain International Health Figure 2 . Timeline of IgM, IgG and total antibody kinetics during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The level of IgM in an individual with the activated humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 continues to rise until it peaks at the third week following infection. By the end of the third week, IgM levels decrease with a concomitant elevation in the level of IgG from the third to the seventh week postonset symptom (POS). For the total antibody, it peaks at the middle of the second week and reaches a plateau in the middle of the third week. The blood concentration persists for several weeks and months postinfection (image made with Biorender.com). capture immunoassay was used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM detection. On the other hand, an indirect ELISA kit based on recombinant NP antigen was used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection. 17 The seroconversion rates recorded were 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7% for total antibodies, IgM and IgG, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between severely and mildly affected COVID-19 patients.",

However, the sensitivity increased steadily from the eighth to the 39th day PSO and overtook that of the RT-PCR test. 17 More significantly, detectable and measurable levels of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 in the sera were found in COVID-19 patients with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their respiratory tract samples. 17 These results highlighted the importance of combining molecular and serological tests for the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease. In agreement with these reports, Jin et al. recorded the specificity of serum anti-SARS-CoV IgM and IgG as 90% compared with that of the RT-PCR test. 23 In a study by Guo et al., which was carried out on two cohorts of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the early antibody response to NP protein was evaluated. Of 208 patients, 90.4% and 93.3% harbored plasma IgM and IgA, respectively.

Inactivated virus or virus-like particles can also elicit IgM response, but factors induced when an active virus infection is ongoing seem very important and are required before there can be induction of the isotype switch and then IgG or IgA responses. 26 In another study of 214 COVID-19 patients, 68.2% and 70.1% were positive for rN-specific IgM and IgG, respectively; and 77.1% and 74.3% were positive for rS-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. 27 These findings indicated that the detection of rS-specific IgM was more sensitive compared with that of rN-specific IgM, which may be because of the lower immunogenicity of the N protein compared with that of the S protein. A bioinformatics study reported a lower number of B cell epitopes in the NP protein of SARS-CoV-2 than in the S protein, especially as the positive rates of IgM and IgG were low during the early stages of the disease (0-10 days post-disease onset (DPO)). On the other hand, IgM and/or IgG specific for rN and rS reached a climax at 11-15 DPO. 27 The sensitivity of the tests and the epitope on which the test is based are significant factors for the well-organized detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and timing of the humoral A.

For example, Li et al. developed a point-ofcare LFIA test based on the RBD antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein that can help in the concomitant detection of IgM and IgG in human blood within 15 min, with higher sensitivity than the individual IgG and IgM tests; however, the detection limit of the test was not determined. 19 Also, Amanat et al. developed sensitive and specific ELISA assays based on the recombinant fulllength S protein and RBD epitope, permitting the screening and detection of seroconversion upon SARS-CoV-2 infection 3 d PSO. 28 Of note, no cross-reactivity from other human coronaviruses was noted, in agreement with another study highlighting that S1 is a specific antigen for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, as cross-reactive antibodies against the S protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were not detected in a COVID-19 patient. 29 Additionally, strong IgA and IgM responses were discovered and the IgG3 response was stronger than that of IgG1. 28 The sensitivity of the test may create challenges for the early detection of IgM. Several patients were more positive for IgG than IgM during the time of hospital stay and 5 d later; likewise, they had an earlier IgG than IgM seroconversion. 30 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in the sera of six infants born to mothers with COVID-19. Five of the six infants and their mothers had elevated levels of IgG and two of them also had elevated levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM. Three of the six infants who had elevated levels of IgG also had normal levels of IgM. However, two of their mothers displayed elevated levels of IgM. How the newborns that developed IgM require additional investigation. Undeniably, due to its large magnitude, IgM is not typically transferred through the placenta; however, it is affected by some pathology that compromises its configuration. The newborn might be in contact with the virus if the latter crosses the placenta, although no virus was detected from RT-PCR analysis. 31 Currently, several studies are investigating the connection between antigen-specific antibodies and the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, but interestingly, among people with comorbidities, lesser anti-RBD IgG, but not anti-NP IgM or IgG, have been reported, although the difference was not significant when compared with people without comorbidities.",

Broadly, these serological tests can be divided into tests that (1) can be performed at the point of care; (2) can be performed in routine diagnostic laboratories; and (3) can only be performed in specialized reference laboratories.",

The relatively cheap and simple nature of lateral flow assays means that production is suited to scaling up for increased testing capacity. However, there are limited published data on the performance characteristics of serological POCT, and high-quality data are urgently Table 3 . International Health needed to guide laboratories, public health agencies and governments in the appropriate and responsible deployment of POCT, and serological assays more broadly. Currently, the WHO recommends the use of POCT immunodiagnostic assays in research settings only, and not for clinical decision-making until further evidence is available. 13 Ideally, validation of serological assays, including POCT, should be performed against a serum panel that includes samples from (1) patients at acute and convalescent stages of infection (to assess sensitivity) and (2) patients with other human coronavirus infections (to assess specificity). Also, serological tests are relevant to fully characterize the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response. Differences in the profile of the antibody response across patients might reveal important aspects of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, explaining the great differences observed in the general population. Indeed, the correlation with disease severity and clinical characteristics is poorly understood. Old age and comorbidities seem to increase the risk for a poor outcome of the disease; however, increasing cases of young people who experience severe illness, requiring hospitalization for assistance by mechanical ventilation, may pose questions about the leading factors of disease progression. 32 Some challenges are posed by the potential cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses, due to their high homology at the genetic level. The evidence related to this aspect are still controversial; however, SARS-CoV-specific antibodies are undetectable in the sera of patients 6 y after infection. This observation excludes the presence of cross-reactivity in the sera of COVID-19 patients and might make researchers confident about the specificity of these antibodies. 32 Moreover, it would be interesting to understand whether the differences in the progression of the disease might be related to the level of the immune response.",

While none of the antibody-based serological assays have been approved by the WHO, a number of them have been approved for clinical and epidemiological use in some countries. 32 Antibody testing might have a useful role in clinically diagnosing COVID-19 patients with late presentations, prolonged symptoms and those with negative results from RT-PCR tests. Furthermore, these tests could be used to monitor the quality and duration of humoral immune response in COVID-19 patients and vaccination.

For instance, a study referred to as the 'COVID-19 Testing Project' was conducted by the University of California, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and the University of California. 33 This study evaluated 10 lateral flow assays and 2 ELISAs to assess performance characteristics for anti-SARS-CoV-2 33 on plasma/serum of 80 symptomatic COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR positive results, 52 non-SARS-COV-2 patients' respiratory viral infections (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative) and 108 archived sera of blood donors collected in 2018 or earlier. 33 The assessment found that the assays of the products had varying sensitivities that increased over time, increasing from about 81% to 100% at \u02c320 d PSO. 33 Based on this, it was inferred that anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests were important for longitudinal studies because a negative result may indicate an actively infected person who has not developed a detectable level of antibodies to the virus. Conversely, the proportion of false-positive samples reported from the non-COVID-19 group ranged from 0% to 16%. The detection agreement indices of the lateral flow assays and ELISAs ranged from 75% to 94%. 33 In another evaluation study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based tests by the Chinese company Innovita, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of COVID-19-confirmed patients with an assay specificity of 96%. 34 After FDA authorization, these tests were anticipated for at-home use. 34 Despite the merits of serological devices, limitations abound due to issues of misdiagnosis following indications of significant false-negative and false-positive results observed during the evaluation of these kits and devices during quality checks.",
