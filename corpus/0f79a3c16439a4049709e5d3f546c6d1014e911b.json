In particular, all non-essential medical and surgical activity was suspended in order to increase capacity to manage COVID-19 patients, to limit the risk of overwhelming intensive care units and to provide care in the safest possible manner to patients with other pathologies, especially cancer patients who in case of COVID-19 infection have a five-fold risk of developing a severe illness and a four-fold risk of death.",

The management of endometrial cancers was also found to have been impacted and, in low-risk cases, an alternative treatment with neo-adjuvant hormonotherapy was offered among 31% of patients. In cases of high-risk endometrial cancer, a sentinel node examination was done in 69% of cases. In cases of ovarian cancer, surgery was postponed in 27% of cases and neoadjuvant chemotherapy offered in over 30% of cases. For Cervical cancers, although surgery remained the principal treatment option, it was postponed for early-stage cancers in 15% of cases.
